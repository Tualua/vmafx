"""A/B the fork's CPU throughput against upstream Netflix/vmaf at a pinned commit.

Every other benchmark in this repo compares the fork against *itself* — one
backend against another, or one commit against a recorded baseline. None of
them answer the question this one exists for: **is the fork actually faster
than the thing it forked, and did it stay exact while getting there?**

Two results per cell, and the second one gates the first:

* **speedup** — upstream median wall-clock over fork median wall-clock. Higher
  is better; 1.00 means no gain.
* **score parity** — the upstream parity guard's comparison
  (`scripts/dev/upstream_parity.py`, ADR-1487) of the model on the same
  fixtures: every value both trees emit at `%.17g`, against the allowlist of
  recorded deviations. A speedup bought by changing the score is not a
  speedup, it is a regression with a nice number attached, so a difference
  the allowlist does not cover fails the run regardless of timing.

Upstream is built at the commit the repository records as the head it is at
parity with (`docs/development/known-upstream-bugs.md`), by the guard's own
build step; `--upstream-ref` names another commit or tag. The fork side is the
golden-profile build the guard uses (in the guard's work directory), so the
binary that is timed is the one whose scores are checked. The guard's verdict
is evidence only in the pinned environment (the dev container image); a bench
run on the host reports it as advisory.

The CPU path is the only honest A/B surface: upstream has no SYCL, HIP or Metal
backend, and its CUDA backend covers a different feature set. Comparing the
fork's GPU throughput against upstream's CPU would measure the hardware, not
the work. `testdata/bench_backends.py` is where per-backend numbers live.

Measurement discipline is inherited from ADR-1185 / `bench_backends.py`, since
a number produced differently is not comparable to the ones already recorded:
one discarded warmup per cell, `--runs` timed repetitions reported as the
median, min/max spread alongside, and the 1-minute load average sampled around
every cell.
