"""Phase B — target-VMAF bisect.

Given a (source, codec, target VMAF) triple, find the *largest* CRF
whose actual measured VMAF still meets the target. "Largest" because
higher CRF = lower bitrate at acceptable quality — that's the cost-
optimal point on the CRF axis.

The algorithm is the obvious one (matches the analytical-curve binary
search in :func:`vmaftune.predictor.pick_crf` but operates on real
encodes via the existing :mod:`vmaftune.encode` / :mod:`vmaftune.score`
seams):

1. Encode at the midpoint CRF of the current ``[lo, hi]`` window and
   score with libvmaf.
2. If measured VMAF >= target, the window narrows upward
   (try a higher CRF — we can compress harder).
3. Else the window narrows downward (we need higher quality).
4. Stop when the window collapses to a single CRF or after
   ``max_iterations``.

The midpoint rounds toward the **lower-quality** end of the window so
we never accept a CRF whose VMAF we have not actually measured: a
clean off-by-one safety net for the "best so far" record.

The bisect assumes monotone-decreasing VMAF in CRF for the (codec,
content) under test. Adjacent samples that violate this contract are
flagged via ``error`` rather than silently accepted; we never
fall back to a different search strategy because the AGENTS-pinned
invariant is "bisect requires monotonicity, hard error otherwise"
(see ``tools/vmaf-tune/AGENTS.md`` Phase B section). Real-world content
is monotone in CRF for every modern codec; pathological cases are
ours-to-fix in the encoder, not ours-to-paper-over here.

Subprocess boundary is the test seam: ``encode_runner`` and
``score_runner`` mirror the pattern from ``encode.run_encode`` /
``score.run_score`` so unit tests inject deterministic stubs.

Phase B is the production wiring the existing ``compare`` /
``recommend-saliency`` / ``predict`` / ``tune-per-shot`` / ``ladder``
subcommands have been stubbing out via the
``NotImplementedError("Phase B pending")`` placeholder predicate.
