"""Shared lookups of the VMAFx C sources and ``vmaf`` CLI for the vmaf-tune tests.

The source-pinning tests read the CLI sources under ``core/tools/`` and
the integration tests run the fork's ``vmaf`` binary. Both lookups live
here so a rename (``vmaf.c`` to ``vmaf.cpp``, ``libvmaf/`` to ``core/``)
fails every caller at once instead of turning some of them into silent
skips. The binary itself comes from ``scripts/lib/vmaftest.py``, the one
resolver every Python suite uses: ``VMAF_BIN``, ``VMAF_BIN_FOR_TESTS``,
then the repository's build directories, never ``PATH``.
