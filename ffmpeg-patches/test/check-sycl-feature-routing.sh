# check-sycl-feature-routing.sh — patch-text contract for libvmaf_sycl feature
# routing (ADR-1764).
#
# Asserts that patch 0005:
#   1. resolves feature= names through vmaf_feature_backend_twin;
#   2. replaces the vmaf_use_feature() call of parse_features with use_feature();
#   3. restricts QSV zero-copy to NV12 / P010 surfaces.
#
# What the filter does on a failed VA import is not checked here: that is the
# subject of VMAFx/vmafx#2110 (retry, then fail naming the frame) and its own
# check there.
#
# No FFmpeg build or GPU is needed; the patch text is inspected directly.
#
# Exit codes:
#   0  all assertions pass
#   1  at least one assertion failed
#   77 patch file not found (skip)
