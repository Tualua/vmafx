# scripts/ci/observability-compose-smoke.sh — start the Compose observability
# example (deploy/compose/observability) and run its smoke test
# (tools/obssmoke): every component scraped, the rendered rules healthy,
# every dashboard query returning data, Grafana provisioned, traces in Tempo
# (ADR-2349, ADR-2399).
#
# Usage: scripts/ci/observability-compose-smoke.sh [--build] [--keep]
#   --build  build the VMAFx images from this checkout first (docker compose
#            build; the node image builds FFmpeg, which takes a while)
#   --keep   leave the stack running afterwards (default: docker compose down -v)
#
# VMAFX_IMAGE_REGISTRY and VMAFX_TAG name the images (default local/...:dev,
# what --build produces). The media is the 576x324 pair of testdata/, written
# as Y4M and raw into a temporary directory. Host ports are ephemeral, so the
# run does not collide with services already listening. The node is
# restarted once it has been scraped, which the restart annotation shows.
# Exit: 0 every check passed, 1 a check failed, 2 a usage or setup error.
