# require-private-ghcr-package.sh — exit 0 only when an organisation's GHCR
# container package is private (ADR-1564).
#
# The dev container (`ghcr.io/vmafx/vmafx-dev-mcp`, the `libvmaf-build` stage
# of dev/Containerfile) holds the full CUDA toolkit, Intel's oneAPI Base Kit
# and the ROCm payload. Their licences allow internal use; they do not allow
# the toolkit files to be redistributed (CUDA EULA 1.1.1 and Attachment A;
# Intel EULA for Developer Tools 2.1). Pushing a new version into a public
# package would distribute them, so dev-container-publish.yml runs this check
# before it pushes.
#
# Usage: require-private-ghcr-package.sh <org> <package>
#
# Reads GET /orgs/<org>/packages/container/<package> with `gh api` (GH_TOKEN:
# the publishing job's token, which reads a package whose Actions access
# grants the repository a role). Fails closed: an API error, an unknown
# package, an answer without a string `visibility`, or any visibility other
# than "private" exits 1. Wrong usage exits 2.
