# ADR-1763: The SYCL primary queue, which runs the VA-surface import, uses immediate command lists

- **Status**: Accepted
- **Date**: 2026-10-02
- **Deciders**: lusoris
- **Tags**: `sycl`, `zero-copy`, `level-zero`, `correctness`, `driver-workaround`, `fork-local`

## Context

The zero-copy path of the `libvmaf_sycl` filter imports every decoder surface
with `zeMemAllocDevice` (DMA-BUF), copies or de-tiles its luma into the shared
frame slot, and frees the import with `zeMemFree` after the frame's queue wait
(`core/src/sycl/dmabuf_import.cpp`, ADR-1121). That work runs on the primary
SYCL queue, which several extractors and the host-upload path share.

On an Intel Arc A380 (i915, compute-runtime 26.35.39758.10, Level Zero 1.34.0)
with Unified Runtime's batched command lists
(`UR_L0_USE_IMMEDIATE_COMMANDLISTS=0`, the setting
[the bundling page](../backends/sycl/bundling.md) recommends for Arc A-series and
`scripts/test/sycl-dev-container.sh` forces), zero-copy `cambi` differed from
host upload in 3 to 7 of every 10 runs. Measured in the debug session
`sycl-zerocopy-cambi-nondeterminism`:

- From a random frame on, the import's writes into the shared slots stop
  landing; the slots keep two old frames and every extractor scores them.
  Canary kernels on the same queue are dropped as well. `wait_and_throw()`
  reports no error.
- The driver maps each new import at the GPU address the previous frame's import
  just freed. Delaying the free (new address every frame) or never freeing
  (a per-surface import cache) avoids the failure; waiting for every queue
  before the free does not.
- With immediate command lists globally, or on the primary queue alone, the
  failure does not occur, with the same address reuse. The primary queue's
  mode is what matters: a separate import-only queue with immediate command
  lists next to a batched primary queue still failed (8 of 12 runs), while a
  batched import queue next to an immediate primary queue did not (0 of 12).
  The primary queue is the one the imports are made against and the one
  `vmaf_sycl_queue_wait` synchronises before freeing them every frame.

The defect sits in the driver stack (a submission is silently discarded), not in
libvmaf's synchronisation. An upstream report is drafted, not filed.

## Decision

We will create the primary SYCL queue (`sycl_queue_props()` in
`core/src/sycl/common.cpp`), on which the VA-surface import runs, with
`sycl::ext::intel::property::queue::immediate_command_list`, guarded by
`SYCL_EXT_INTEL_QUEUE_IMMEDIATE_COMMAND_LIST`. The copy queue, the combined
graph queue and every per-extractor queue keep the process's command-list mode,
so the batched-mode advice for Arc A-series stays for them. Without the
extension macro (another SYCL implementation) the property is left out; on a
backend other than Level Zero it has no effect. The primary queue stays
immediate while the driver defect exists; `zerocopy-e2e.sh --repeat 10` under
`UR_L0_USE_IMMEDIATE_COMMANDLISTS=0` is the re-test.

## Alternatives considered

| Option | Pros | Cons | Why not chosen |
|---|---|---|---|
| Immediate primary queue (chosen) | 0 divergent runs in every measured case; zero-copy throughput within noise of HEAD | Extractors that share the primary queue and the host-upload path also leave the batched mode (measured within noise) | Chosen (D-08, option C' as measured) |
| Separate import-only queue with immediate command lists | Leaves the primary queue's mode alone | Still fails: 8 of 12 runs, `--repeat 10` 4/10 and 6/10 on src01 `cambi` | Does not fix the defect |
| Session cache of imports per surface | No address reuse, independent of the command-list mode | Every live import joins each submission's residency: +7 % ms per frame, -6 to -7 % fps at 1080p | Throughput loss above the phase budget |
| Delay each free by two frames | -2 to -4 % fps | Works only because the driver does not recycle the address yet; undocumented | Fragile |
| Stop recommending batched command lists | No code change | Gives up the Arc A-series workaround for every kernel | Rejected (D-08) |

## Consequences

- **Positive**: zero-copy scores are deterministic and equal host upload under
  both command-list modes.
- **Negative**: the kernels that run on the primary queue (among them
  `float_ssim`, `ssim`, `psnr_hvs`, `ciede`, SpEED, `float_vif` and the host
  upload path's helpers) also run on immediate command lists; measured on the
  A380 their host-upload run time moved by -5.5 % to +5.7 %, inside the
  run-to-run spread. The workaround depends on the DPC++ extension and must be
  re-tested when the driver changes.
- **Neutral / follow-ups**: once compute-runtime fixes the drop, re-test with
  `--repeat 10` under `UR_L0_USE_IMMEDIATE_COMMANDLISTS=0` with the property
  removed before dropping the queue.
