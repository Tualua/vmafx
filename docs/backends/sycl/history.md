# SYCL change history

This page is the dated log of the SYCL backend: what each change did, the
measurements that came with it, and how to re-run them. Entries are newest
first and record the state on their date. For current behaviour read the
[SYCL overview](overview.md) and the [twin notes](twins.md); a later entry or
[`docs/state.md`](../../state.md) supersedes an earlier statement.

Measured numbers name their hardware: an Intel Arc A380 (DG2, xe driver), an
Arc B580 (Xe2), an Arc Pro B60, and a UHD 770 (Xe-LP), all with Level Zero.

## `float_moment_sycl` matches the CPU `float_moment` past 2^53 units too (2026-10-03)

`float_moment_sycl` now returns the CPU extractor's four moments bit for bit on
every frame
([ADR-1497](../../adr/1497-float-moment-twins-cpu-sum-past-2-53.md)). The CPU
adds the float squares into one `double` in raster order. Below 2^53 units of
2^-16 that sum is exact and equal to the twin's integer sum, which covers every
frame of up to 2 097 152 pixels and every 8-, 10- and 12-bit frame.

On a larger 16-bit frame whose sum passes 2^53 the CPU rounds as it adds, and
the twin used to round the exact sum once.

It now forms the CPU's rounded sum: on such a frame four more kernels add each
row exactly while the sum is at or below 2^53, then from integer increments of
the sum's last place, composed in pixel order and checked against the exact
running sum, and term by term where a row crosses into the next binade
(`core/src/feature/float_moment_sum.h`). Frames that cannot pass 2^53 run no new
work.

### Measured agreement

Measured on an Arc A380 at `--precision max` against `--backend cpu`, frames
whose four outputs are identical and the largest difference:

| Fixture | Before | Now |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Full-range 16-bit noise 3840x2160, nine tenths near the peak, 16 frames | 0 of 16, 2.7e-7 | 16 of 16 |
| The same at 7680x4320, 4 frames | 0 of 4, 5.1e-7 | 4 of 4 |
| BBB 3840x2160 widened to 16 bits (shifted left by 8, times 257, full range with a dithered low byte), 32 frames each, 17 of them past 2^53 | 32 of 32 | 32 of 32 |

BBB was identical before as well: its widened samples have no bits below the
sum's last place until 2^55, which a 3840x2160 frame cannot reach. The parity
gate's `float_moment` cell reads 0 at tolerance 0 on the 16-bit 3840x2160
noise (it failed there before).

### Cost

Time per 16-bit 3840x2160 frame through libvmaf, pictures preloaded, medians
of 5 interleaved runs at a load average of 4 to 5, before and after:

| Input | Before | After |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Noise, every frame past 2^53 | 31.84 ms | 34.62 ms |
| BBB full range, 17 of 32 frames past 2^53 | 32.05 ms | 33.02 ms |

The four kernels use integers only and no scratch memory
(`test_sycl_kernel_scratch`), and compile for every ahead-of-time target.

```shell
python3 scripts/ci/cross_backend_parity_gate.py --vmaf-binary build/tools/vmaf \
    --reference ref_16bit_3840x2160.yuv --distorted dis_16bit_3840x2160.yuv \
    --width 3840 --height 2160 --bitdepth 16 --backends cpu sycl --features float_moment
```

## `float_motion_sycl` emits `motion3` (2026-10-03)

`float_motion_sycl` provided `motion` and `motion2` only. A
`--backend sycl --feature float_motion` run ran the twin and wrote no `motion3`
without a warning, and a request with `motion_blend_factor` or
`motion_blend_offset` ran on the CPU, because the twin did not declare them
(`T-GPU-FLOAT-MOTION3-MISSING-2026-09-30` in [`state.md`](../../state.md)). The
twin now provides `VMAF_feature_motion3_score` and takes both options (aliases
`mbf` / `mbo`), as the CUDA and HIP twins do.

`motion3` is computed on the host from the SADs the twin already returns bit for
bit (ADR-1411), with the CPU's `motion_blend_clip()`: the score is weighted by
`motion_fps_weight`, blended, then capped at `motion_max_val`. Frame 0 takes the
first SAD, the last frame comes from `flush()`, a one-frame input gets `motion3`
= 0, and `motion_force_zero` publishes 0 for it. No kernel changed.

### Measured agreement

Measured on the Arc A380 at `--precision max` against `--backend cpu`, all
outputs and pooled values identical:

| Fixture | Option sets | Frames identical |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Netflix 576x324 | defaults, blend, `mfw=2:mmxv=4`, all four score options, `motion_force_zero` | 48 of 48, each of the three scores |
| Netflix 576x324, `--frame_cnt 1` | the same five | 1 of 1 (`motion3` = 0) |
| Checkerboard 1920x1080, 1 px and 10 px shift | the same five | 3 of 3 |
| BBB 3840x2160 | defaults, blend | 200 of 200 |

"Blend" is `motion_blend_factor=0.5:motion_blend_offset=2`, "all four" adds
`motion_fps_weight=2:motion_max_val=5` to
`motion_blend_factor=0.25:motion_blend_offset=3`.
The parity gate's `float_motion` cell now compares `motion3` too; a twin that
lacks it fails the cell (`missing metrics`), which the twin before this change
does. `test_sycl_twin_option_parity` carries the `motion3`, blend,
weight-and-cap, `motion_force_zero` and one-frame cases, and also the cases
of the 2026-09-30 follow-ups above (flat identical frames, a single-pixel
frame, `apsnr` with `--subsample 2`, `motion_v2` weight, cap and one frame),
which it did not have before.

```bash
vmaf --reference ref.yuv --distorted dist.yuv --width 576 --height 324 \
    --pixel_format 420 --bitdepth 8 --backend sycl --no_prediction \
    --feature float_motion=motion_blend_factor=0.5:motion_blend_offset=2 \
    --precision max --json --output /dev/stdout
```

## `float_ms_ssim_sycl` adds its per-scale sums in the CPU's order (2026-10-02)

`float_ms_ssim` calls the same routine as `float_ssim` once per scale and
uses its luminance, contrast and structure means, so the defect of the
previous section applied to it: the twin added each scale's terms as
integers per work-group, an exact sum where the CPU keeps a running `double`
that rounds. On a 176x176 pair of noise the twin's `float_ms_ssim_l_scale0`
was 0.9884905219078064 where the CPU's is 0.9884904623031616, the next
`float` down.

The twin now stores `l`, `c` and `s` of every window of every scale, `l` and
`c` as the CPU's `double` values, and the host adds them in the CPU's order
([ADR-1466](../../adr/1466-sycl-float-ms-ssim-raster-sum.md)). The pair
arithmetic for `l` and `c` and the fixed-point sums are gone from
`core/src/feature/sycl/sycl_ssim_terms.h`; both SSIM twins use the same
functions.

A second pair, found by the HIP lane and shared by the tests of all three
backends (`core/test/float_ms_ssim_order_frame.h`), moves
`float_ms_ssim_c_scale1` on the CUDA and HIP twins. The SYCL twin returned the
CPU's value on it before this change and does after: its old sum was exact,
and on that pair the exact sum rounds to the CPU's `float`.

### Measured agreement

Measured on an Arc A380 (xe) at `--precision max` against a GCC build of the CPU
extractor, on 138 frames (the fixtures of the previous section): `float_ms_ssim`
138 of 138, with `enable_lcs` 2208 of 2208 values.

With `enable_chroma`, on the 69 frames whose chroma planes are large enough, 206
of 207 values; the one that differs does so by 1.1e-16 through the host's
`pow()`, which an icx build takes from Intel's math library, and the CPU
extractor of the same binary differs from the GCC build on that value too.

| Input, options | Before | After |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 3840x2160 | 44.7 ms | 75.9 ms |
| 3840x2160, `enable_lcs` | 44.9 ms | 76.0 ms |
| 3840x2160, `enable_chroma` | 65.2 ms | 112.4 ms |
| 1920x1080 | 11.5 ms | 18.2 ms |
| 1920x1080, `enable_lcs` | 11.3 ms | 19.2 ms |
| 576x324 | 1.16 ms | 1.92 ms |

### Cost

Per frame, medians of 7 interleaved runs of 25 frames, host load average 13 to
15; a control with the same code in both builds read 2.95 and 2.92 ms.

The CPU extractor takes 409 ms per 3840x2160 frame on one thread and 58.7 ms
with 16 threads, so at that size the twin is now slower than a 16-thread CPU
run; `--backend cpu` is the faster choice for 4K `float_ms_ssim` on this device
until the tuning row is worked.

Of the extra time at 3840x2160 about 8 ms are kernel arithmetic, 21 ms the copy
of 219 MB of terms to the host and 5 ms the host's additions; the row
`T-SYCL-FLOAT-MS-SSIM-RASTER-SUM-THROUGHPUT-2026-10-02` in
[`state.md`](../../state.md) holds the split and the candidates. The twin holds
20 bytes per window on the device and in pinned host memory: 219 MB at 3840x2160
(327 MB with `enable_chroma`), 54 MB at 1920x1080.

```bash
ONEAPI_DEVICE_SELECTOR=level_zero:0 python3 scripts/ci/cross_backend_parity_gate.py \
    --vmaf-binary build/tools/vmaf --features float_ms_ssim float_ms_ssim_lcs \
    --backends cpu sycl \
    --reference python/test/resource/yuv/src01_hrc00_576x324.yuv \
    --distorted python/test/resource/yuv/src01_hrc01_576x324.yuv \
    --width 576 --height 324
```

## `float_ssim_sycl` adds its frame sums in the CPU's order (2026-10-02)

`float_ssim_sycl` returned the CPU's `float_ssim` on every frame of real
content measured and was declared an exact twin. It was not exact on every
input: on a constructed 64x64 pair the CPU scores -4.222829943500983e-07 and
the twin scored -4.222829659283889e-07, the next `float`
([ADR-1463](../../adr/1463-sycl-float-ssim-raster-sum.md)).

The CPU adds one term per window into a `double`, window after window, and that
running sum rounds at every add. The twin added the terms as integers per
work-group, which is another sum of the same windows: more accurate, and not the
CPU's.

The two differ around 1e-16 relative, and the result is rounded to `float`, so
the difference shows only when the mean falls that close to a rounding boundary.
That happens on pictures whose terms cancel, such as independent noise: 3 frames
in 27 million at 64x64 in a search. None of the 333 frames of the sweep above
differs.

The twin now computes each window's luminance and contrast terms as the
CPU's `double` values (in 64-bit integers, because a SYCL kernel has no
`double`), stores the term of every window and lets the host add them in the
CPU's order. With `enable_lcs` it stores the three terms and the host forms
the four sums.

### Measured agreement

Measured on an Arc A380 (xe) at `--precision max` against a GCC build of the
CPU extractor: the constructed pair is identical, with and without
`enable_lcs`; so are 2070 of 2070 values on 138 frames (the fixtures of the
sweep above, BBB 3840x2160 with 50 frames) under six option sets: default,
`enable_lcs`, `scale=1`, `enable_lcs` with `scale=1`, `scale=3`, and
`enable_lcs` with `scale=2`.

### Cost

What it costs depends on the scale. `float_ssim` shrinks the picture first
(to at most 480x270 for 1080p and 4K input unless `scale` says otherwise),
and the number of terms is the number of pixels after that:

| Input, options | Before | After |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1920x1080, automatic scale | 1.32 ms | 1.51 ms |
| 1920x1080, `enable_lcs` | 1.34 ms | 1.60 ms |
| 3840x2160, automatic scale | 3.93 ms | 4.11 ms |
| 3840x2160, `enable_lcs` | 4.25 ms | 4.35 ms |
| 576x324 (scale 1) | 0.56 ms | 0.86 ms |
| 1920x1080, `scale=1` | 5.9 ms | 9.9 ms |
| 1920x1080, `scale=1`, `enable_lcs` | 6.5 ms | 12.4 ms |
| 3840x2160, `scale=1` | 23.3 ms | 39.1 ms |
| 3840x2160, `scale=1`, `enable_lcs` | 25.5 ms | 48.6 ms |

Per frame, medians of 7 interleaved runs of 50 frames (host load average 22 to
26; a control with the same code in both builds read 2.93 and 2.92 ms). At
3840x2160 with `scale=1` the 16 ms are 7 ms of kernel arithmetic, 6 ms for
reading 66 MB back and 3 ms of host additions; the row
`T-SYCL-FLOAT-SSIM-RASTER-SUM-THROUGHPUT-2026-10-02` in
[`state.md`](../../state.md) holds the split and the candidates.

The twin also holds 8 bytes per window on the device and in pinned host memory
(20 with `enable_lcs`): 66 MB (165 MB) at 3840x2160 with `scale=1`, 1 MB (2.4
MB) at the automatic scale.

### Re-running the check

To check a build, score the constructed pair.
`core/test/float_ssim_order_frame.h`
holds it as two C arrays; the Python lines below regenerate the same bytes:

```bash
python3 -c "
import random
n = 6144
for name, seed in (('ref', 174), ('dis', 175)):
    open(f'order_{name}_64x64.yuv', 'wb').write(random.Random(seed).randbytes(20000 * n)[14161 * n:14162 * n])"
for b in cpu sycl; do
  vmaf -r order_ref_64x64.yuv -d order_dis_64x64.yuv -w 64 -h 64 -p 420 -b 8 \
    --no_prediction --feature float_ssim --backend "$b" --precision=max --json -q -o "order_$b.json"
done
python3 -c "import json; print([json.load(open(f'order_{b}.json'))['frames'][0]['metrics']['float_ssim'] for b in ('cpu', 'sycl')])"
```

It prints `[-4.222829943500983e-07, -4.222829943500983e-07]`; before, the
second value was `-4.222829659283889e-07`.

`float_ms_ssim_sycl` computed its per-scale means the old way and had the
same defect; it follows
[below](#float_ms_ssim_sycl-adds-its-per-scale-sums-in-the-cpus-order-2026-10-02).

## Exact twins declared as a group (2026-10-02)

`adm_sycl`, `motion_sycl`, `motion_v2_sycl`, `psnr_sycl`, `float_ssim_sycl`
and `cambi_sycl` returned the CPU's bits already and were compared with a
tolerance of 5e-5. They are declared exact twins now
([ADR-1451](../../adr/1451-sycl-exact-twins-declared.md)): the parity gate
compares `adm`, `motion`, `motion_debug`, `motion_v2`, `psnr`, `float_ssim`,
`float_ssim_lcs` and `cambi` with tolerance 0, and `test_sycl_exact_twins`
holds every output of the six twins to `==` on a device.

A twin is listed when it reaches the CPU's value by construction and a sweep
measured it identical. The sweep, on an Arc A380 at `--precision max`: the
Netflix 576x324 pair at 8, 10, 12 and 16 bits and as 10-bit 4:2:2, both
1920x1080 checkerboard pairs, full-range noise at four bit depths, a bright
16-bit 1920x1080 pair, BBB 3840x2160 widened to 16 bits and 200 frames of BBB
3840x2160.

Every one of the 333 frames was identical for each of the eight features, and
`float_ssim` at `scale=1` on 50 frames of BBB 3840x2160.

Two features were not in the first declaration:

- `speed_chroma` was identical on all 333 frames as well. Its `log2` was a
  correctly rounded evaluation on the device, where the CPU calls the math
  library of the build, so the equality depended on that library. Since
  [ADR-1477](../../adr/1477-speed-upstream-double-math.md) the twin's
  logarithms are the host's and `speed_chroma` and `speed_temporal` are
  listed (`scripts/ci/exact_twins.d/speed_chroma.sycl`,
  `speed_temporal.sycl`).
- `ciede` is within 1.4e-11 of the CPU by its derived bound (ADR-1436).

One of the listed twins is exact within a stated range: `cambi` while
`cambi.c`'s own top-K sum is exact (ADR-1357). `float_ssim` was listed as
exact up to the `float` rounding of the frame mean; a constructed frame
showed that this is not exact, and since
[ADR-1463](../../adr/1463-sycl-float-ssim-raster-sum.md) the twin adds the
CPU's terms in the CPU's order
([below](#float_ssim_sycl-adds-its-frame-sums-in-the-cpus-order-2026-10-02)).

```bash
ONEAPI_DEVICE_SELECTOR=level_zero:0 python3 scripts/ci/cross_backend_parity_gate.py \
    --vmaf-binary build/tools/vmaf \
    --reference python/test/resource/yuv/src01_hrc00_576x324.yuv \
    --distorted python/test/resource/yuv/src01_hrc01_576x324.yuv \
    --width 576 --height 324 --backends cpu sycl
```

## `float_psnr_sycl` matches the CPU `float_psnr` at every bit depth (2026-10-02)

`float_psnr_sycl` returns the CPU extractor's score bit for bit
([ADR-1450](../../adr/1450-sycl-float-psnr-exact-block-sums.md), after
ADR-1440 for the HIP twin). The CPU squares each sample difference in `float`
and adds the squares in `double`, which does not round. The kernel formed the
same squares and added each 16x16 work-group in `float`: exact at 8 bits, and
at 10, 12 and 16 bits only while a group's differences are small. It now
converts each `float` square to an integer and the sub-groups, the
work-groups and the host add `uint64` values.

Found by the same sweep as the `float_moment` defect above; the repository's
high-bit-depth clips are 8-bit content shifted left and show nothing.
Measured on an Arc A380 at `--precision max` against `--backend cpu`:

| Fixture | Before | Now |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Netflix 576x324 at 8 to 16 bits and 4:2:2, both 1080p checkerboards, BBB 3840x2160, noise at 8 bits | 269 of 269 | 269 of 269 |
| Full-range noise 576x324 at 10, 12 and 16 bits, 3 frames each | 0 of 9, 2.4e-8 dB | 9 of 9 |
| Bright 16-bit 1920x1080 (samples 56000 to 64000), 2 frames | 0 of 2, 7.4e-8 dB | 2 of 2 |
| BBB 3840x2160 widened to 16 bits, 8 frames | 0 of 8, 3.3e-8 dB | 8 of 8 |

The same holds with `uncapped=true`. The reference in that table is the CPU
extractor of the same build, which is what the parity gate compares. Against
a GCC build 6 of the 288 frames differ by at most 1.4e-14 dB: the noise is
equal and the host's `log10` is Intel's in one build and glibc's in the
other.

At 16 bits the CPU's own sum is exact up to a mean squared error of
2^37 / (width x height) on the 8-bit scale (a PSNR below 6 dB at 3840x2160).
Beyond it the CPU rounds as it adds the rows and the twin is within 7e-13 dB.

### Cost

A 3840x2160 frame takes 3.41 ms, 3.31 ms before (medians of 7 runs; the
`psnr_sycl` control read 2.93 and 2.94 ms); a 576x324 frame 0.12 ms, as
before. The read-back is 8 bytes per work-group where it was 4. The parity
gate compares the twin with tolerance 0.

```bash
ONEAPI_DEVICE_SELECTOR=level_zero:0 python3 scripts/dev/speed_gpu_parity.py \
    --backend sycl --vmaf "$PWD/build/tools/vmaf" --feature float_psnr
```

## `float_moment_sycl` matches the CPU `float_moment` at 16 bits (2026-10-02)

`float_moment_sycl` returns the CPU extractor's four moments bit for bit
([ADR-1449](../../adr/1449-sycl-float-moment-cpu-float-squares.md), after
ADR-1447 for the HIP twin). The CPU forms each sample's square in `float`
before adding it. Up to 12 bits that is the integer square; at 16 bits it is
the square rounded to 24 bits. The kernel added exact integer squares, so its
second moments were the CPU's up to 12 bits and not at 16. It now adds the
`float` square, an integer below 2^32, into the same `int64` sums.

A sweep of every SYCL twin on fixtures the parity gate does not use found it:
the repository's 16-bit Netflix clip is 8-bit content shifted left, whose
squares have few significant bits. Measured on an Arc A380 at
`--precision max` against `--backend cpu`, frames whose second moments are
identical and the largest difference:

| Fixture | Before | Now |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Netflix 576x324 at 8 to 16 bits and 4:2:2, both 1080p checkerboards, BBB 3840x2160, noise at 8, 10 and 12 bits | 275 of 275 | 275 of 275 |
| Full-range noise 576x324, 16 bit, 3 frames | 0 of 3, 2.7e-5 | 3 of 3 |
| Bright 16-bit 1920x1080 (samples 56000 to 64000), 2 frames | 0 of 2, 1.0e-4 | 2 of 2 |
| BBB 3840x2160 widened to 16 bits, 8 frames | 0 of 8, 3.9e-5 | 8 of 8 |

The sums are exact integers, and so is the CPU's running `double` sum while
it is below 2^53 units of 2^-16. That covers every frame of up to 2 097 152
pixels and every 8-, 10- and 12-bit frame. On a larger 16-bit frame whose
sum of squares passes 2^53 the CPU rounds each further add, and the twin,
which rounds once, is within a derived bound of it (2.7e-7 measured on a
2560x1440 frame, bound 6.6e-6). Since 2026-10-03 that range is bit-identical
too
([below](#float_moment_sycl-matches-the-cpu-float_moment-past-253-units-too-2026-10-03)).

### Cost

The frame time is unchanged: 28.7 ms per 3840x2160 frame and 0.6 ms per
576x324 frame on the A380, before and after. Most of the 28.7 ms is the
reduction, four atomic adds per pixel
(`T-SYCL-FLOAT-MOMENT-PER-PIXEL-ATOMICS-2026-10-02`). The parity gate
compares the twin with tolerance 0.

```bash
ONEAPI_DEVICE_SELECTOR=level_zero:0 python3 scripts/dev/speed_gpu_parity.py \
    --backend sycl --vmaf "$PWD/build/tools/vmaf" --feature float_moment
```

## `ssimulacra2_sycl` matches the CPU `ssimulacra2` exactly (2026-10-02)

`ssimulacra2_sycl` returns the CPU extractor's score bit for bit
([ADR-1446](../../adr/1446-sycl-ssimulacra2-cpu-bits.md), after ADR-1433 for
the CUDA twin and ADR-1445 for the HIP twin). Its fp32 planes were already
the CPU's. Two things in the last stage were not:

- `ssimulacra2.c` forms six terms per sample and channel in `double`. The
  kernel formed each as a pair of `float` values, which is within about 2^-44
  of the `double` and not equal to it
  ([fp64-less contract](developer-notes.md#fp64-less-device-contract-t7-17)). It
  now runs the
  CPU's `double` operations, one for one, on a significand and an exponent
  held in 64-bit integers (`core/src/feature/sycl/sycl_ssimulacra2_math.h` on
  `core/src/feature/sycl/sycl_soft_signed.h`).
- The CPU adds each term into one `double`, pixel after pixel. The kernel
  added the pairs in a fixed tree. It now forms the CPU's sums from parallel
  pieces as the CUDA twin does (`core/src/feature/ordered_sum.h`, used here
  through bit patterns in `core/src/feature/sycl/sycl_ordered_sum.h`): per
  chunk of 512 consecutive pixels the terms become whole-number steps of the
  running sum, composed in pixel order, and one walk per sum adds the chunks,
  term by term where the sum passes a power of two. The old pair sums remain
  as advice for that walk's plan; a wrong plan costs time and cannot change
  the result.

### Measured agreement

Measured on an Arc A380 (xe driver, Level Zero, icpx 2026.0) at
`--precision max` against `--backend cpu`, frames identical and the largest
difference:

| Fixture | Before | Now |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Netflix 576x324, 48 frames | 0 of 48, 1.1e-12 | 48 of 48 |
| Checkerboard 1920x1080, 1 px shift, 3 frames | 0 of 3, 2.6e-13 | 3 of 3 |
| Checkerboard 1920x1080, 10 px shift, 3 frames | 0 of 3, 7.6e-11 | 3 of 3 |
| BBB 3840x2160, 200 frames | 0 of 200, 7.2e-13 | 200 of 200 |
| Netflix 576x324 at 10, 12 and 16 bits and 4:2:2 10-bit, 3 frames each | 0 of 3, 1.0e-12 | 3 of 3 |

Also identical: `yuv_matrix` 1, 2 and 3 on the Netflix pair and the 10 px
checkerboard. What each cause contributed, from the new twin with one piece
put back (Netflix, 1 px checkerboard, 10 px checkerboard, BBB):

| Piece put back | Largest difference |
| --- | --- |
| Each term the old pair of `float` values, added in the CPU's order | 1.1e-12, 2.0e-13, 2.7e-12, 1.0e-12 |
| The exact terms, added per 512-pixel chunk and the chunk sums in order | 1.3e-13, 3.4e-13, 7.2e-11, 4.5e-13 |

The reference was a GCC build of the CPU extractor; the CPU extractor of the
icx build gives the same scores on these frames. The last step of the score
is the host math library's `pow()`, Intel's in an icx build and glibc's in a
GCC build; a difference there would be between the two CPU extractors, and
none was seen.

### Cost

Through the `vmaf` tool on the A380 a 3840x2160 frame takes 194.7 ms, 84.1 ms
before (medians of 7 runs of 20 frames; the `float_psnr` control read 3.26 and
3.27 ms), and a 576x324 frame 13.5 ms, 5.3 before. The CPU extractor takes about
125 ms and 1.4 ms on sixteen threads, so on this card it is now the faster path
at 3840x2160 as well.

By builds with stages removed, 69.1 ms are the stages the twin had before
(upload, conversion, XYB, blurs, downsample), 12.8 the `float` advice sums, 7.9
the plan, 81.7 the terms in integer arithmetic and their steps, and 20.0 the
walk; at 576x324 the walk is 5.5 of the 13.5 ms, because it runs on one lane per
sum and one lane of this device is slow.

The twin holds 18 MB more device memory at 3840x2160 and launches six kernels
per scale where it launched two. No kernel uses [scratch
memory](overview.md#scratch-memory-on-intel-gpus-adr-1395). Getting the time
back is `T-SYCL-SSIMULACRA2-EXACT-THROUGHPUT-2026-10-02` in
[`state.md`](../../state.md).

The parity gate compares the twin with tolerance 0
([cross-backend gate](../../development/cross-backend-gate.md)), and the Arc
A380's 5e-2 calibration for this feature is gone.

```bash
ONEAPI_DEVICE_SELECTOR=level_zero:0 python3 scripts/dev/speed_gpu_parity.py \
    --backend sycl --vmaf "$PWD/build/tools/vmaf" --feature ssimulacra2
```

## `float_adm_sycl` matches the CPU `float_adm` exactly (2026-10-02)

`float_adm_sycl` returns every output of the CPU float ADM extractor bit for
bit ([ADR-1434](../../adr/1434-sycl-float-adm-cpu-arithmetic.md), after
ADR-1420 for the CUDA twin). The DWT and the decouple's quotient were already
the CPU's (the CPU divides since
[ADR-1442](../../adr/1442-float-adm-reference-divides.md)); the rest was not.
What changed, with the largest difference each item alone leaves on the
Netflix 576x324 pair and on BBB 3840x2160
([Research-1434](../../research/1434-sycl-float-adm-fp64-free-arithmetic.md)):

| What the twin did | What `adm_tools.c` does | Netflix | BBB 4K |
| --- | --- | ---: | ---: |
| compared the angle test with `cos^2 * (o^2 * t^2)` | `(cos^2 * o^2) * t^2` | 2.4e-6 | 1.28e-5 |
| added the row sums in `double` on the host, per sub-group before | one `float` per row, then one over the rows | 1.9e-7 | 1.8e-7 |
| used `float` constants for 1/30 and 1/15 | `double` literals | 1.2e-9 | 2.4e-9 |
| added the centre tap of the masking threshold last | fifth of nine, per band | 1.2e-9 | 2.4e-9 |
| multiplied the enhancement gain in `float` (at `adm_enhn_gain_limit=1.2`) | in `double` | 0 | 6.0e-10 |

A SYCL kernel has no `double`
([fp64-less contract](developer-notes.md#fp64-less-device-contract-t7-17)). The
three `double`
expressions are evaluated as exact pairs of `float` values; a result that
lies next to a `float` rounding boundary, about one evaluation in 131 000 by
the width of the test, replays the CPU's `double` operations in 64-bit
integers (`core/src/feature/sycl/sycl_float_adm_math.h`). The CSF weights,
the reduced region, the pooling and the frame floor are the CPU's own
routines.

### Measured agreement

Measured on an Arc A380 (xe driver, Level Zero, icpx 2026.0) at
`--precision max` against `--backend cpu`, outputs identical and the largest
difference:

| Fixture | Before | Now |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Netflix 576x324, 48 frames, 7 outputs | 59 of 336, 2.5e-6 | 336 of 336 |
| Checkerboard 1920x1080, 1 px shift, 3 frames | 1 of 21, 3.5e-7 | 21 of 21 |
| Checkerboard 1920x1080, 10 px shift, 3 frames | 4 of 21, 1.5e-7 | 21 of 21 |
| BBB 3840x2160, 200 frames | 301 of 1400, 1.7e-5 | 1400 of 1400 |

Also identical: the Netflix pair at 10, 12 and 16 bits and as 4:2:2 10-bit,
`debug=true` (18 outputs), `adm_enhn_gain_limit` of 1.0, 1.2 and 37.5,
`adm_bypass_cm`, `adm_noise_weight=0`, `adm_p_norm=1`, and the four options
the twin did not have before: `adm_skip_scale0`, `adm_skip_aim_scale`,
`adm_f1s0..3` and `adm_f2s0..3`. `adm_p_norm` other than 1 or 3 is within
1.8e-7 (the device's `pow` against the host's).

The reference in that table is the CPU extractor of the same build, which is
what the parity gate compares. Against a GCC build of the CPU extractor,
`aim` and `adm3` differ on 2 of the 200 BBB frames by 1.6e-9: the final roots
are the host math library's `powf`, Intel's in one build and glibc's in the
other. That difference is between the two CPU extractors.

### Cost

Through the `vmaf` tool on the A380 a 3840x2160 frame takes 12.3 ms, 15.1 ms
before (medians of 11 runs of 50 frames), and a 576x324 frame 0.59 ms, 0.57
before. The twin stores nine terms per sample of the reduced region, 48 MB
of device memory at 3840x2160, and copies one block of row sums to the host
per frame, four before. No kernel uses
[scratch memory](overview.md#scratch-memory-on-intel-gpus-adr-1395).

```bash
ONEAPI_DEVICE_SELECTOR=level_zero:0 python3 scripts/dev/speed_gpu_parity.py \
    --backend sycl --vmaf "$PWD/build/tools/vmaf" --feature float_adm
```

## `integer_ssim_sycl` matches the CPU `ssim` exactly (2026-10-02)

`integer_ssim_sycl` returns the CPU fixed-point `ssim` extractor's score bit
for bit ([ADR-1443](../../adr/1443-sycl-ssim-cpu-arithmetic.md)). Its int64
window moments were already the CPU's. Two things were not:

- `integer_ssim.c` forms each pixel's term in `double`. The kernel used
  `float` for it ([fp64-less
  contract](developer-notes.md#fp64-less-device-contract-t7-17)). It
  now runs the CPU's `double` operations, one for one and in the CPU's order,
  on a significand and an exponent held in 64-bit integers
  (`core/src/feature/sycl/sycl_integer_ssim_math.h` on
  `core/src/feature/sycl/sycl_soft_signed.h`), and stores the bit pattern of
  the resulting `double`.
- `calc_ssim()` adds every term into one `double`, left to right and top to
  bottom. The kernel added `float` partial sums per 16x8 work-group. The host
  now reads the plane of terms back and adds it in the CPU's order.

### Measured agreement

Measured on an Arc A380 (xe driver, Level Zero, icpx 2026.0) at
`--precision max` against `--backend cpu`:

| Fixture | Before | Now |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Netflix 576x324, 48 frames | 0 of 48, 6.9e-9 | 48 of 48 |
| Checkerboard 1920x1080, 1 px shift, 3 frames | 0 of 3, 1.0e-7 | 3 of 3 |
| Checkerboard 1920x1080, 10 px shift, 3 frames | 0 of 3, 1.1e-7 | 3 of 3 |
| BBB 3840x2160, 200 frames | 0 of 200, 3.1e-7 | 200 of 200 |
| Netflix 576x324 at 10 and 12 bits and 4:2:2 10-bit, 3 frames each | 0 of 3, 4.4e-9 | 3 of 3 |
| Netflix 576x324 at 16 bits, 3 frames | the run failed (`invalid ratio`) | 3 of 3 |

What each cause contributed, from the new twin with one piece put back
(Netflix, 1 px checkerboard, 10 px checkerboard, BBB 20 frames):

| Piece put back | Largest difference |
| --- | --- |
| The term computed in `float` | 6.6e-9, 9.4e-8, 1.1e-7, 3.1e-7 |
| `float` partial sums per 16x8 block | 1.3e-8, 6.8e-8, 5.6e-8, 1.5e-8 |
| The exact term stored as a `float` | 9.4e-11, 3.2e-9, 3.3e-9, 3.7e-10 |
| `double` sums per 16x8 block (the order alone) | 2.3e-14, 1.6e-12, 1.1e-11, 5.6e-13 |

The reference was a GCC build of the CPU extractor; the CPU extractor of the
icx build gives the same scores. With `enable_db` the twin equals the CPU
extractor of its own build on every frame; against the GCC build 10 of 266
frames differ by at most 3.6e-15, which is the host's `log10` (Intel's math
library in an icx build, glibc's in a GCC build) and not the twin.

### Cost

Through the `vmaf` tool on the A380 a 3840x2160 frame takes 31.9 ms, 17.8 ms
before (medians of 11 runs of 50 frames, host load average 9 to 11; the
`float_psnr` control read 3.28 ms on both builds), and a 576x324 frame 0.78 ms,
0.45 before.

Of the 31.9 ms, 7.2 are the term's integer arithmetic, 5.8 the read-back of 66
MB, 2.8 the host's 8.3 million additions and 16.4 the uploads and the two moment
passes the twin had before. The CPU extractor takes 111 ms. The term kernel runs
at SIMD-16 with the large register file and uses no [scratch
memory](overview.md#scratch-memory-on-intel-gpus-adr-1395).

The window weight is no longer a device plane, so device memory is unchanged;
the twin holds 66 MB more pinned host memory at 3840x2160. Getting the time back
is `T-SYCL-SSIM-EXACT-THROUGHPUT-2026-10-02` in [`state.md`](../../state.md).

The parity gate compares the twin with tolerance 0
([cross-backend gate](../../development/cross-backend-gate.md)).

```bash
ONEAPI_DEVICE_SELECTOR=level_zero:0 python3 scripts/ci/cross_backend_parity_gate.py \
    --vmaf-binary build/tools/vmaf \
    --reference python/test/resource/yuv/src01_hrc00_576x324.yuv \
    --distorted python/test/resource/yuv/src01_hrc01_576x324.yuv \
    --width 576 --height 324 --features ssim --backends cpu sycl
```

## `ciede_sycl` follows the CPU `ciede` to 1.4e-11 (2026-10-01)

`ciede.c` computes in `double` and stores in `float`. A SYCL kernel has no
`double` ([fp64-less
contract](developer-notes.md#fp64-less-device-contract-t7-17)), and `ciede_sycl`
used `float` throughout, the device's `float` math functions and a sum per 16x16
block. It was up to 1.14e-5 from the CPU.

Since [ADR-1436](../../adr/1436-sycl-ciede-cpu-arithmetic.md) the kernel runs
the CPU's statements with every `double` as a pair of `float` values (about 48
bits) and every math-library call as a function on such pairs
(`core/src/feature/ciede_ff_math.h` and `core/src/feature/ff_math.h`, shared
with the HIP twin since ADR-1448; `sycl_ciede_math.h` and `sycl_ff_math.h` name
the SYCL primitives they use), rounds to `float` where the CPU does, and stores
one `float` per pixel; the host adds them in the CPU's order.

Each piece of the old twin on its own, largest difference on the Netflix
576x324 pair and on BBB 3840x2160
([Research-1436](../../research/1436-sycl-ciede-fp32-pairs.md) has all
thirteen):

| What the twin did | Netflix | BBB 4K |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| the linear Lab branch as `7.787 t + 16 / 116` (the CPU: `(24389 / 27 * t + 16) / 116`) | 1.12e-5 | 1.05e-6 |
| the CPU's constants as `float` | 5.3e-7 | 6.7e-7 |
| `x^2.4` from the device's `float` `pow` | 2.3e-7 | 5.9e-7 |
| the colour conversion arithmetic in `float` | 2.1e-7 | 2.1e-7 |
| sums of 256 pixels in `float`, those in `double` | 2.0e-7 | 8.0e-8 |
| the cube root from the device's `float` `cbrt` | 5.0e-8 | 3.8e-7 |

### Measured agreement

Measured on an Arc A380 (xe driver, Level Zero, icpx 2026.0) at
`--precision max` against `--backend cpu`, identical frames and largest
difference:

| Fixture | Before | Now |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Netflix 576x324, 48 frames | 0 of 48, 1.14e-5 | 47 of 48, 6.9e-13 |
| Netflix 576x324 at 10, 12, 16 bits and 4:2:2 10-bit, 3 frames each | | 3 of 3 each |
| Checkerboard 1920x1080, 1 px and 10 px shift, 3 frames each | 3 of 3 | 3 of 3 |
| BBB 3840x2160, 200 frames | 0 of 20 (first 20), 1.3e-6 | 0 of 200, 1.4e-11 |

That is where the CUDA twin is, which has `double`. What is left is the C
library: on three 3840x2160 frames the device's 24.9 million values equal the
CPU's statements evaluated with a correctly rounded `powf` on every pixel;
18 to 64 per frame differ from the GCC build's CPU extractor, where glibc's
`powf` rounds the other way, and 7 to 30 from the icx build's. The twin is
therefore not listed as exact; the parity gate compares it at `1e-9`
([cross-backend gate](../../development/cross-backend-gate.md)).

### Cost

Through the `vmaf` tool on the A380 a 3840x2160 frame takes 50.3 ms, 16.2 ms
before (medians of 11 paired runs, paired difference 33.9 ms), and a 576x324
frame 1.2 ms, 0.45 before. Of the 50 ms, 11 are the uploads, the read-back and
the host's sum, 19 the two Lab conversions and 21 the difference formula.

The twin keeps one `float` per pixel on the device and in pinned host memory, 33
MB each at 3840x2160. No kernel uses [scratch
memory](overview.md#scratch-memory-on-intel-gpus-adr-1395): the per-pixel
function is flattened into the kernel, because a call inside a kernel takes its
frame from scratch memory.

```bash
ONEAPI_DEVICE_SELECTOR=level_zero:0 python3 scripts/dev/speed_gpu_parity.py \
    --backend sycl --vmaf "$PWD/build/tools/vmaf" --feature ciede --max-abs-diff 1e-9
```

## `vif_sycl` matches the CPU `vif` exactly (2026-10-01)

`vif_sycl` returns every output of the CPU integer VIF extractor bit for bit
([ADR-1432](../../adr/1432-sycl-integer-vif-exact-gain.md)). Two changes got
it there:

- The host stores each scale's numerator and denominator sum in a `float`,
  divides in single precision and adds the rounded sums for the debug
  outputs, as `integer_vif.c` does. It kept them in `double` before.
- `integer_vif.c` forms a pixel's gain in `double` and truncates
  `sigma2_sq - g * sigma12` and `g * g * sigma1_sq` to integers. The kernel
  used `float` for it ([fp64-less
  contract](developer-notes.md#fp64-less-device-contract-t7-17)).
  It now gets both integers from one integer division by `sigma1_sq` and the
  remainder, and replays the CPU's `double` operations in 64-bit integers for
  a pixel whose value lies within the `double` chain's own rounding error of
  an integer: one pixel in 300 000 on real content
  (`core/src/feature/sycl/sycl_integer_vif_math.h`).

### Measured agreement

Measured on an Arc A380 (xe driver, Level Zero, icpx 2026.0) at
`--precision max` against `--backend cpu`, identical frames on the scale
that has the fewest and largest difference:

| Fixture | Before either change | Host sums only | Now |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Netflix 576x324, 48 frames | 0 of 48, 3.5e-7 | 12 of 48, 3.6e-7 | 48 of 48 |
| Checkerboard 1920x1080, 1 px shift, 3 frames | 0 of 3, 3.9e-8 | 2 of 3, 6.0e-8 | 3 of 3 |
| Checkerboard 1920x1080, 10 px shift, 3 frames | 1 of 3, 1.5e-14 | 3 of 3 | 3 of 3 |
| BBB 3840x2160, 200 frames | 0 of 20 (first 20), 1.7e-7 | 140 of 200, 1.8e-7 | 200 of 200 |

Also identical now: the Netflix pair at 10, 12 and 16 bits and as 4:2:2
10-bit, `debug=true` (15 outputs), `vif_enhn_gain_limit` of 1.0, 1.2 and
37.5, `vif_skip_scale0`, and a 3840x2160 clip scored against itself. The
reference was a GCC build of the CPU extractor; the CPU extractor of the icx
build gives the same values.

### Cost

Through the `vmaf` tool on the A380 a 3840x2160 frame takes 22.21 ms, 21.46
ms before (medians of 11 paired 100-frame runs), and a 576x324 frame 0.88 ms,
0.79 before. No kernel of the twin uses
[scratch memory](overview.md#scratch-memory-on-intel-gpus-adr-1395); the fused
kernel of scale 0 takes the large register file at SIMD-16 for it.

The twin's `debug` option defaults to `false`, the CPU's default. A run that
relied on the eleven debug outputs (`integer_vif`, `integer_vif_num`,
`integer_vif_den` and the per-scale sums) asks for them:
`--feature vif_sycl=debug=true`. The parity gate compares the twin with
tolerance 0 ([cross-backend gate](../../development/cross-backend-gate.md)).

`sycl::mul_hi()` on 64-bit operands returned wrong values in a kernel on the
A380; the twins form wide products in 32-bit limbs
(`core/src/feature/sycl/sycl_soft_double.h`).

```bash
ONEAPI_DEVICE_SELECTOR=level_zero:0 python3 scripts/dev/speed_gpu_parity.py \
    --backend sycl --vmaf "$PWD/build/tools/vmaf" --feature vif
```

## `float_vif_sycl` matches the CPU `float_vif` exactly (2026-10-01)

`float_vif_sycl` returns every output of the CPU extractor bit for bit
([ADR-1422](../../adr/1422-sycl-float-vif-cpu-arithmetic.md), after ADR-1412
for the CUDA twin). Four things changed:

- The Gaussian taps come from `vif_get_filter()`, which the CPU extractor
  calls at start-up. The twin held a table of decimals the CPU stopped using.
- `log2` is the CPU's polynomial `log2f_approx()`, not the device `log2`.
- The CPU evaluates `1 + (g * g * sigma1_sq) / (sv_sq + vif_sigma_nsq)` and
  `1 + sigma1_sq / vif_sigma_nsq` in `double`, because `vif_sigma_nsq` is one.
  A SYCL kernel has no `double`
  ([fp64-less contract](developer-notes.md#fp64-less-device-contract-t7-17)), so
  the twin
  computes both as pairs of floats and, for a sample next to a rounding
  boundary (about one in 1650), replays the CPU's `double` operations in
  64-bit integers (`core/src/feature/sycl/sycl_float_vif_math.h`).
- The per-pixel terms are added as the CPU adds them: a row into one `float`,
  the rows into another. The twin used to reduce per sub-group and per 16x16
  block and add the blocks in `double`.

### Measured agreement

Measured on an Arc A380 (xe driver, Level Zero, icpx 2026.0) at
`--precision max` against `--backend cpu`, frames identical on all four
scales and largest difference before and after:

| Fixture | Before | After |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Netflix 576x324, 48 frames | 0 of 48, 3.8e-5 | 48 of 48 |
| Checkerboard 1920x1080, 1 px shift, 3 frames | 0 of 3, 1.0e-6 | 3 of 3 |
| Checkerboard 1920x1080, 10 px shift, 3 frames | 1 of 3, 1.1e-12 | 3 of 3 |
| BBB 3840x2160, 200 frames | 0 of 20, 7.0e-6 (first 20) | 200 of 200 |

Also identical after the change: the Netflix pair at 10, 12 and 16 bits,
`debug=true` (15 outputs), and `vif_enhn_gain_limit`, `vif_sigma_nsq`,
`vif_skip_scale0` and the per-scale floors at non-default values. The
reference was a GCC build of the CPU extractor; the CPU extractor of the icx
build gives the same values.

The twin now runs three kernels per scale (filter, statistic, row sums)
instead of one. Through the `vmaf` tool on the A380 a 3840x2160 frame takes
23.95 ms, 20.54 ms before (medians of 15 paired 100-frame runs; the untouched
`float_psnr_sycl` read 3.34 and 3.33), and a 576x324 frame 0.93 ms, 0.73 ms
before. It uses 100 MB more device memory at 3840x2160. None of its kernels
uses [scratch memory](overview.md#scratch-memory-on-intel-gpus-adr-1395).

The twin accepts the CPU's `vif_scale1_min_val`, `vif_scale2_min_val` and
`vif_scale3_min_val` options now. The parity gate compares it with tolerance
0 ([cross-backend gate](../../development/cross-backend-gate.md)).

```bash
ONEAPI_DEVICE_SELECTOR=level_zero:0 python3 scripts/dev/speed_gpu_parity.py \
    --backend sycl --vmaf "$PWD/build/tools/vmaf" --feature float_vif
```

### Re-running the check

It prints, per output, how many frames are bit-identical and the largest
difference, and exits 0 only when every frame is.

## `float_ms_ssim_sycl` computes the CPU's arithmetic (2026-10-01)

`float_ms_ssim_sycl` returns the CPU extractor's per-scale means bit for bit
([ADR-1414](../../adr/1414-sycl-float-ms-ssim-cpu-arithmetic.md)). Four things
differed from the CPU, the same four the CUDA twin had
([ADR-1403](../../adr/1403-cuda-strict-fp-every-kernel.md)):

- the decimate added `sample * tap` in two roundings where
  `ms_ssim_decimate.c` fuses each tap; it now calls `sycl::fma()`;
- the Gaussian window sums were fp32 running sums where `iqa_convolve()` adds
  fp32 products in `double`; they are exact pairs of floats now;
- `l`, `c` and `s` were fp32 quotients where the CPU divides `double`
  numerators by fp32 denominators for `l` and `c`; `l` and `c` are pairs now;
- the host combined unrounded means and took no `fabs()` of `l` and `c`; it
  now rounds each mean to fp32 and combines as `ms_ssim.c` does.

The pair arithmetic is the one `float_ssim_sycl` already used; both twins
take it from `core/src/feature/sycl/sycl_ssim_terms.h`. The per-pixel terms
are summed in 64-bit fixed point, which is exact in any order. No kernel uses
the fp64 type or scratch memory. (An exact sum is not the CPU's running sum;
since ADR-1466 the terms are the CPU's doubles and the host adds them in the
CPU's order,
[below](#float_ms_ssim_sycl-adds-its-per-scale-sums-in-the-cpus-order-2026-10-02).)

### Measured agreement

Measured on an Arc A380 at `--precision max` against a GCC build of the CPU
extractor: the score is identical on the Netflix 576x324 pair (48 frames;
before 6.9e-8), both 1080p checkerboard pairs (before 1.06e-6 and 2.98e-6)
and 199 of 200 frames of BBB 3840x2160 (before 1.23e-6), and every
`enable_lcs` and `enable_chroma` output is identical. The one remaining
frame differs by 1.1e-16 through the host's `pow()`: an icx build links
Intel's math library. The numbers per fixture are in
[MS-SSIM](../../metrics/ms-ssim.md#agreement-with-the-cpu).

The parity gate compares this twin with tolerance 0, with and without
`enable_lcs`. That cell runs the CPU extractor of the same binary, which on
an AVX-512 host must be built without FP contraction (#1706; before it, the
CPU `float_ms_ssim` of an icx build was one fp32 unit off in a per-scale mean
on 4 of 104 frames).

### Cost

It costs time: 42.6 ms per 3840x2160 frame against 31.4 before, 1.20 ms per
576x324 frame against 0.84 (the CPU extractor: 117 ms at 3840x2160).

```bash
ONEAPI_DEVICE_SELECTOR=level_zero:0 python3 scripts/ci/cross_backend_parity_gate.py \

    --width 576 --height 324
```

## `float_motion_sycl` matches the CPU `float_motion` exactly (2026-10-01)

`float_motion_sycl` returns the CPU extractor's `motion` and `motion2` bit for
bit ([ADR-1411](../../adr/1411-sycl-float-motion-cpu-float-sum.md)). It used
to sum the absolute differences of each 32x4 work-group on the device and the
groups in `double` on the host. The CPU extractor adds a row into one `float`,
the row sums into another, and divides in `float`; the result depends on that
order. The twin now adds each row on the device in the CPU's order, one
work-item per row, and the host adds the rows
(`core/src/feature/float_motion_sad.h`, shared with the CUDA twin).

Measured on an Arc A380 (xe driver, Level Zero, icpx 2026.0) at
`--precision max` against `--backend cpu`, frames identical and largest
difference before and after:

| Fixture | Before | After |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Netflix 576x324, 48 frames | 1 of 48, 3.1e-6 | 48 of 48 |
| Checkerboard 1920x1080, 1 px shift, 3 frames | 1 of 3, 1.36e-4 | 3 of 3 |
| Checkerboard 1920x1080, 10 px shift, 3 frames | 1 of 3, 1.36e-4 | 3 of 3 |
| BBB 3840x2160, 200 frames | 1 of 50, 2.4e-5 (first 50) | 200 of 200 |

The one frame that matched before is frame 0, whose scores are 0. Also
identical after the change: the Netflix pair at 10, 12 and 16 bits and as
4:2:2 10-bit, and with `motion_fps_weight=0.5:motion_max_val=3`. The
reference was a GCC build of the CPU extractor; the CPU extractor of the icx
build gives the same values.

The row pass reads both blurred planes a second time. Through the `vmaf`
tool on the A380 that costs 0.38 ms per 3840x2160 frame (3.85 to 4.23 ms,
medians of 25 paired 200-frame runs; the untouched `float_psnr_sycl` read
3.37 and 3.38) and 0.07 ms per 576x324 frame (0.15 to 0.22). The kernel
requested a sub-group size of 8, the fastest of the exact shapes measured
(the ADR lists them); it requires 16 since 2026-10-02, because Xe2 devices
do not compile a kernel that requires 8
([below](aot.md#sub-group-sizes-and-the-aot-targets-adr-1468)).

The parity gate compares this twin with tolerance 0
([cross-backend gate](../../development/cross-backend-gate.md)). The twin
provides `motion3` since 2026-10-03 ([next
section](#float_motion_sycl-emits-motion3-2026-10-03)).

```bash
ONEAPI_DEVICE_SELECTOR=level_zero:0 python3 scripts/ci/cross_backend_parity_gate.py \
    --vmaf-binary build/tools/vmaf --features float_motion --backends cpu sycl \
    --reference python/test/resource/yuv/src01_hrc00_576x324.yuv \
    --distorted python/test/resource/yuv/src01_hrc01_576x324.yuv \
    --width 576 --height 324
```

### Re-running the check

The cell reports `exact:ADR-1397` and a largest difference of 0; it does so
on all four fixtures above.

## RC3 SYCL parity follow-ups (2026-09-30)

Three parity gaps between SYCL twins and the CPU reference were resolved:

- **SSIM flat/identical frames (`integer_ssim_sycl`, `float_ssim_sycl`).**
  Implemented CPU reference arithmetic matching the CUDA twin (#1637):
  `float_ssim_sycl` evaluates the CPU's per-pixel `l*c*s` with exact fp32 pairs
  (`Ff`) and fixed-point work-group sums, reduces in double on host, and
  preserves ADR-1370 fp32 frame-mean rounding. `integer_ssim_sycl` groups terms
  as `((weight * a) * b) / denominator` without identical-window shortcuts.
  Both match CPU behavior on flat 64x64 identical frames (72.247199 dB).
  (The pair terms and work-group sums of `float_ssim_sycl` were replaced by
  the CPU's doubles and a host sum in the CPU's order on 2026-10-02,
  ADR-1463.)
- **PSNR temporal subsampling (`integer_psnr_sycl`).** The twin carries
  the `VMAF_FEATURE_EXTRACTOR_TEMPORAL` flag, ensuring `--subsample` scaling
  operates consistently with temporal extractors.
- **Motion v2 weighting and clipping (`integer_motion_v2_sycl`).** `collect()`
  applies `motion_fps_weight` and caps at `motion_max_val`, matching CPU
  `integer_motion_v2.c::extract`. `flush()` derives `motion2_v2` and
  `motion3_v2` with CPU parity including one-frame inputs.

## psnr, psnr_hvs and motion_v2 share the uploaded frame (ADR-1369, 2026-09-29)

Every SYCL run uploads the luma of both pictures once per frame into the state's
shared frame. `psnr_sycl`, `psnr_hvs_sycl` and `motion_v2_sycl` now read it
there instead of uploading their own copies, and chroma goes up once per frame
into shared Cb / Cr planes that exist only when a twin that reads chroma is in
use — a luma-only run, such as the default model, never uploads chroma.

The chroma is packed into a pinned staging buffer and copied with one DMA per
plane. Nothing but the results comes back to the host.
[ADR-1369](../../adr/1369-sycl-shared-planes-light-twins.md) has the design and
[Research-1369](../../research/1369-sycl-shared-planes-light-twins.md) the
per-phase profile.

### Cost

Milliseconds per frame at 3840x2160 (Big Buck Bunny, 8-bit 4:2:0), measured as
(t(22) - t(2)) / 20, median of 5, with the twin named explicitly
(`--backend sycl -n --feature psnr_hvs`):

| Twin | 16 CPU threads | Arc B580 before | Arc B580 after | UHD 770 before | UHD 770 after |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `psnr_hvs` | 6.6 | 17.1 | 7.6 | 124.0 | 59.9 |
| `psnr` | 5.4 | 7.9 | 7.2 | 25.3 | 12.3 |
| `motion_v2` (against [ADR-1371](../../adr/1371-sycl-motion-diff-first-pipeline.md)) | 4.4 | 6.1 | 7.4 | 15.4 | 15.4 |

On the B580 `psnr` and `motion_v2` were already at the rate the CLI reads 4K
frames, and their 22-frame differences are within the measurement noise; over
100 frames `motion_v2` measures 6.1 ms before and 5.4 after (the host copy and
upload it no longer does). Its kernel is the ADR-1371 motion pipeline, which
this change does not touch.

The default model is unchanged (45.4 ms per 4K frame on the B580). At 576x324
every per-frame difference is below the timer noise of the CLI measurement.
Scores are bit-identical to the previous twins on both devices, so `psnr` and
`motion_v2` still equal the CPU and `psnr_hvs` keeps its distance from the CPU
inside the [ADR-1361](../../adr/1361-psnr-hvs-area-scaled-parity-tolerance.md)
gate.

- **psnr_hvs at 9 and 11 bits** now scores the raw sample, as the CPU does;
  it used to score 16 times the sample (through the C API; the CLI accepts
  8, 10, 12 and 16 bits).
- **Zero-copy VA import** (FFmpeg `libvmaf_sycl` with QSV surfaces) imports
  luma only and hands the extractors no host pictures. `motion_v2_sycl` and
  `psnr_hvs_sycl` with `enable_chroma=false` no longer read host pictures, so
  they need only the imported luma; `psnr_sycl` and `psnr_hvs_sycl` with
  chroma fail the frame with `psnr_sycl: frame N chroma not on the device
  (-22)` or `psnr_hvs_sycl: frame N planes not on the device (-22)` where they
  used to dereference the missing picture. This path was not run for this
  change (no VA-API decode under WSL2).
- **One SYCL state, one frame size (fixed since).** A state kept the shared
  planes of the first frame size it saw. When a program reused a state for a
  context with another size, twins that read chroma failed at init and
  luma-only twins scored it wrong. The state now reallocates its shared frame
  when the geometry changes
  (`T-SYCL-SHARED-FRAME-STICKY-GEOMETRY-2026-09-29` in
  [`state.md`](../../state.md), verified by `test_sycl_shared_frame_sticky_geometry`).
- **Profiling a twin.** `VMAF_SYCL_PROFILE=1` gives the primary and combined
  queues `enable_profiling`; with `VMAF_SYCL_NO_GRAPH=1` graph extractors
  submit directly, so every kernel has its own event. Research-1369 describes
  the event-timing build used for the numbers above.

## float_ssim decimation on the device (2026-09-29)

CPU `float_ssim` shrinks both pictures before it computes SSIM, by a factor
it picks from the short side: `max(1, round(min(w, h) / 256))`, so 1 below
384 px, 2 at 853x480, 4 at 1920x1080 and 8 at 3840x2160. `scale=N` (2 to 10)
forces the factor and `scale=1` turns it off. `float_ssim_sycl` used to
implement only factor 1, so at 1080p and 4K the CPU extractor ran instead
and `--backend sycl` printed
`float_ssim_sycl cannot run 3840x2160 8-bit pictures with these options`.

Since [ADR-1370](../../adr/1370-sycl-float-ssim-device-decimation.md) the
twin does the whole reduction on the GPU. It uploads the raw luma samples
(one byte each at 8 bits, instead of four after a host fp32 conversion),
averages each `N x N` block with the CPU's rounding, and runs SSIM on the
smaller planes. The reduced planes are identical to the CPU's bit for bit at
8, 10, 12 and 16 bits, for every factor and for odd sizes. The run needs no
option and prints no warning:

```bash
vmaf -r ref.yuv -d dis.yuv -w 3840 -h 2160 -p 420 -b 8 \
    --backend sycl --feature float_ssim --json -o out.json
# out.json: "feature_backends": [{"extractor": "float_ssim_sycl", "backend": "sycl"}]
```

`enable_lcs`, `enable_db` and `clip_db` work at every factor. The CPU
extractor still runs, with the usual warning, only when the reduced picture
is smaller than SSIM's 11x11 window (for example 100x100 with `scale=10`).

Agreement with `--backend cpu` (largest difference over all frames, the same
on an Arc B580 and a UHD 770):

| Input | Factor | `float_ssim` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Netflix 576x324, 48 frames | auto (1), 2, 3 | 3.0e-7, 6.0e-8, 6.0e-8 |
| BBB 1920x1080, 24 frames | auto (4), 3 | 4.3e-5, 3.7e-5 |
| BBB 3840x2160, 24 frames | auto (8) | 4.3e-5 |
| BBB 853x480 4:4:4, 24 frames | auto (2), 3 | 4.5e-5, 4.8e-5 |

What remains is the twin's fp32 SSIM arithmetic, which uses the combined
Wang formula rather than the CPU's luminance x contrast x structure product
([Research-0985](../../research/0985-sycl-parity-divergence-2026-06-03.md)).
The automatic factors stay inside the 5e-5 cross-backend tolerance; an
explicit `scale=1` or `scale=2` on BBB 1080p is 7.8e-5 or 5.6e-5 from the CPU,
as `scale=1` was before. The dB form magnifies these differences near 1.

### Cost

Time per frame at 3840x2160, 8-bit, whole `vmaf` run, median of three:

| Configuration | ms / frame |
| --- | --- |
| CPU `float_ssim`, `--threads 16` (Core i9-12900K) | 11.0 |
| `float_ssim_sycl`, Arc B580 | 6.7 |
| `float_ssim_sycl`, UHD 770 | 12.0 |
| Before: `--backend sycl` fell back to the CPU, default threads | 29.3 |

The B580 figure is 0.6 ms above what the `vmaf` tool itself spends per 4K
frame. With `scale=1` the B580 drops from 10.6 to 7.8 ms because of the
smaller upload.
[Research-2130](../../research/2130-sycl-float-ssim-device-decimation.md)
has the exactness argument and every measurement.

At the time of this entry the CUDA, HIP and Metal `float_ssim` twins computed
factor 1 only and fell back above it. Since then the CUDA
([ADR-1399](../../adr/1399-cuda-float-ssim-device-decimation.md)) and HIP
([ADR-1405](../../adr/1405-hip-float-ssim-device-decimation.md)) twins decimate
on the device; the Metal twin still computes factor 1 only
(`T-METAL-FLOAT-SSIM-SCALE-GT1-2026-09-29` in [`state.md`](../../state.md)).

## `motion_sycl` matches the CPU `motion` exactly (2026-09-29)

`motion_sycl` now gives the same `integer_motion2` and `integer_motion3`
scores as `--backend cpu`, bit for bit
([ADR-1371](../../adr/1371-sycl-motion-diff-first-pipeline.md)). It used to
blur each frame and compare the blurred frames, while the CPU blurs the
difference of the two frames and rounds after each filter pass. The results
differ by rounding, which averages out over large frames but not small ones:

| Frame | Worst `integer_motion2` difference before | After |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 17x17 | 2.0e-4 | 0 |
| 33x33 | 1.3e-4 | 0 |
| 64x64 | 4.9e-5 | 0 |
| Netflix 576x324 pair | 1.3e-5 | 0 |
| 3840x2160 | 5.6e-6 | 0 |

### Measured agreement

Measured on an Arc B580 and a UHD 770 with 8- and 10-bit input; the
default-model VMAF score at 4K moves by at most 4e-6. `motion_v2_sycl` already
matched the CPU and now shares the same kernel. The motion step reads two
frames instead of one blurred frame, which costs about 11% more device time
at 4K (0.54 instead of 0.48 ms per frame on the B580, 6.8 instead of 6.2 ms on
the UHD 770); a default-model run is unchanged within run-to-run noise. To
check a build:

```bash
for b in cpu sycl; do
  vmaf -r src01_hrc00_576x324.yuv -d src01_hrc01_576x324.yuv -w 576 -h 324 -p 420 -b 8 \
    --no_prediction --feature motion --backend "$b" --precision=max --json -q -o "motion_$b.json"
done
python3 -c "import json; a, b = (json.load(open(f'motion_{x}.json'))['frames'] for x in ('cpu', 'sycl')); print(max(abs(p['metrics']['integer_motion2'] - q['metrics']['integer_motion2']) for p, q in zip(a, b)))"
```

### Re-running the check

It prints `0.0`. At the time of this entry the CUDA, HIP and Metal `motion`
twins still compared blurred frames. Since then the CUDA
([ADR-1372](../../adr/1372-cuda-motion-diff-first-pipeline.md)) and HIP twins
difference first; the Metal twin still blurs first
(`T-METAL-MOTION-BLUR-THEN-DIFF-2026-09-29` in
[`state.md`](../../state.md)).

With `motion_add_uv=true`, `motion_sycl` no longer waits for the U and V
upload inside `submit()`. It stages both planes in pinned host memory and
uploads them on the queue that runs the motion kernels, so the frame keeps a
single wait, in `collect()`. On a 4K clip the host spends 0.6 ms per frame on
it instead of 5.4 ms on the UHD 770 (0.55 instead of 0.89 ms on the B580),
and the scores are unchanged.

### `motion_sycl` emits the SAD score and honours `motion_force_zero` (2026-10-02)

Two outputs of `--backend sycl --feature motion` differed from the CPU's in
what they contain, not in a value:

- **`VMAF_integer_feature_motion_sad_score` was missing.** The CPU `motion`
  extractor writes the frame's SAD score on every frame (weighted by
  `motion_fps_weight`, capped at `motion_max_val`, 0 on frame 0) and derives
  `motion2` / `motion3` from it. `motion_sycl` computed the value and
  published it only as the `debug` score `integer_motion`. It now writes the
  SAD score on every frame.
- **`motion_force_zero=true` was ignored.** The twin handled the option in a
  function libvmaf never calls for a SYCL extractor, so the run returned the
  measured `integer_motion2_force_0` / `integer_motion3_force_0` where the
  CPU returns 0. It now returns 0 for every output on every frame and, like
  the CPU, computes no SAD: no device memory and no kernels for this
  extractor. The shipped model `model/other_models/vmaf_v0.6.1mfz.json` sets
  the option: on `--backend sycl` it scored the Netflix 576x324 pair 76.668
  where `--backend cpu` scores 72.321; both give 72.321 now.

Measured on an Arc A380 (xe) at `--precision max` against a GCC build of the CPU
extractor: every output of every frame identical on 116 frames (Netflix 576x324
at 8, 10 and 16 bits and as 10-bit 4:2:2, a 1080p checkerboard, full-range noise
at 8 and 16 bits, a bright 16-bit 1080p pair, 48 frames of BBB 3840x2160) under
seven option sets: default, `debug`, `motion_force_zero` with and without
`debug`, `motion_moving_average`, weight 1.5 with blend 0.5 / offset 2 / cap 4,
and `debug` with weight 0.3 and cap 0.5. The kernels are unchanged, so the frame
time is too. To check a build:

```bash
for b in cpu sycl; do
  vmaf -r src01_hrc00_576x324.yuv -d src01_hrc01_576x324.yuv -w 576 -h 324 -p 420 -b 8 \
    --no_prediction --feature motion --backend "$b" --precision=max --json -q -o "motion_$b.json"
done
python3 -c "import json; a, b = (json.load(open(f'motion_{x}.json'))['frames'] for x in ('cpu', 'sycl')); print(all(p['metrics'] == q['metrics'] for p, q in zip(a, b)))"
```

It prints `True`; before, the SYCL frames had no
`VMAF_integer_feature_motion_sad_score`. The parity gate's `motion` and
`motion_debug` cells compare the SAD score since this change
([cross-backend gate](../../development/cross-backend-gate.md)).
`motion_metal` still lacks the output
(`T-GPU-MOTION-SAD-SCORE-NOT-EMITTED-2026-10-02` in
[`state.md`](../../state.md)).

## CPU options on the PSNR, SSIM and float-motion twins (2026-09-29)

Four SYCL twins now take the CPU extractor's full option table
([ADR-1365](../../adr/1365-sycl-twin-cpu-option-parity.md)). Before, a model
that set one of these options computed the feature on the CPU (ADR-1183), and
naming the twin with the option failed with `unknown option`.

| Twin | Options added | Agreement with `--backend cpu` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `psnr_sycl` | `enable_mse`, `enable_apsnr`, `reduced_hbd_peak`, `min_sse` | bit-exact, `apsnr_*` included |
| `integer_ssim_sycl` | `enable_db`, `clip_db` | bit-exact since [ADR-1443](../../adr/1443-sycl-ssim-cpu-arithmetic.md) (then: as the linear score, up to 1.5e-8, mapped through the dB slope) |
| `float_ssim_sycl` | `enable_lcs`, `enable_db`, `clip_db` | `float_ssim_l/c/s` within 8.3e-7; dB as above |
| `float_motion_sycl` | `motion_max_val` (`mmxv`) | within 5.6e-6, as the default score; frames at the cap exact |

### Measured agreement

Measured on an Arc B580 and a UHD 770 over the Netflix 576x324 pair, 853x480
(4:4:4, 8- and 10-bit) and 576x324 10-bit, with every option alone and
combined. The dB form of SSIM magnifies a linear difference by
`4.34 / (1 - ssim)`, so the fp32 twins land within 3.4e-5 dB of the CPU on
that content, and further apart as the score nears 1.

Behaviour that changed with the options:

- **Identical frames.** Both SSIM twins now score identical windows exactly 1,
  as the CPU does, so `enable_db` reports `+inf` and `clip_db` the CPU's
  ceiling, instead of the finite dB value of an fp32 rounding residue. The
  default linear scores moved by at most 1.1e-8 (2.2e-8 on identical frames,
  which now score exactly 1), far inside the twins' parity tolerance.
- **`motion_force_zero` on `float_motion_sycl`** was declared but ignored: the
  twin emitted real scores. It now emits zeros, like the CPU.
- **The debug `motion` score of `float_motion_sycl`** now carries
  `motion_fps_weight`, as on the CPU; before it was emitted unweighted.

With `--backend sycl`, the CPU extractor names run on these twins with the
options set ([ADR-1359](../../adr/1359-cli-feature-backend-twin.md)); the twin
names work too:

```bash
vmaf ... --backend sycl --feature psnr=enable_mse=true:enable_apsnr=true
vmaf ... --backend sycl --feature float_ssim=enable_lcs=true:enable_db=true:clip_db=true
vmaf ... --backend sycl --feature float_motion_sycl=motion_max_val=4
```

The JSON `feature_backends` receipt lists `psnr_sycl`, `float_ssim_sycl` and
`float_motion_sycl` for these runs. `--feature float_motion` on SYCL reports
`motion`, `motion2` and `motion3`; before 2026-10-03 it reported no `motion3`
([below](#float_motion_sycl-emits-motion3-2026-10-03)).

At the time of this entry the CUDA, HIP and Metal twins still lacked these
options. Since then the CUDA
([ADR-1373](../../adr/1373-cuda-twin-cpu-option-parity.md)) and HIP twins take
them; the Metal twin does not yet
(`T-BUG048-GPU-OPTION-PARITY-REMAINDER-2026-09-26`
in [`state.md`](../../state.md)).

## Arc B580, small frames and device faults (2026-09-29)

Five fixes from one investigation on an Arc B580 (Xe2) and a UHD 770
(Xe-LP); the measurements are in
[Research-2123](../../research/2123-sycl-b580-psnr-hvs-and-tile-halo-faults.md).

- **`psnr_hvs_sycl` runs on Xe2.** It used to crash the process with
  SIGSEGV on the B580: the Intel GPU compiler (IGC 2.41.5) crashed while
  compiling the kernel at SIMD32. Its 8x8 DCT now runs in local memory instead
  of one work-item's private memory. Scores are bit-identical wherever the old
  kernel ran, and a 4K frame costs 130 ms instead of 208 ms on the UHD 770.
- **Small frames no longer lose the device.** Frames 64 rows high or less
  used to end in `UR_RESULT_ERROR_DEVICE_LOST` with `adm_sycl`, and so did
  small frames with `vif_sycl` and `motion_sycl` on the B580. The tiled kernels
  now keep their tile loads inside the plane; scores for other frames are
  unchanged.
- **`vif_sycl` needs frames of at least 16x16.** Each VIF scale halves the
  plane and reflects its filter taps once, which only stays inside a plane of
  at least 9, 10, 12 and 16 pixels for scales 0 to 3. When libvmaf picks the
  twin itself, from a model's VIF features, frames below 16 pixels in either
  dimension are computed by the CPU `vif` extractor, with the log line
  `feature extractor 'vif_sycl' cannot honour WxH; computing 'vif' on the CPU`,
  and the scores are the CPU's. (The default model cannot run below 17x17
  anyway: its ADM needs that on every backend.) Naming the twin directly, as in
  `--feature vif_sycl`, fails instead:
  ``vif_sycl requires width >= 16 and height >= 16 (got 8x8); the CPU extractor
  `vif` computes smaller frames``. Since then the CUDA twin checks it too
  ([ADR-1374](../../adr/1374-cuda-integer-tiny-frame-guards.md)) and so does
  the HIP twin; the Metal twin does not yet
  (`T-GPU-INTEGER-VIF-MIN-DIM-TWINS-2026-09-29`).
- **`vif_sycl` is correct for odd widths.** When a scale's width was odd
  (854x480, 1366x768 and 853x480 are common examples), scales 1 to 3 were read
  at the wrong row stride and drifted from the CPU by up to 1.2e-3, which moved
  the VMAF score as well. They now agree with the CPU within 1e-6 at those
  sizes.
- **A device fault fails the run.** When the device reports a fault, the
  graph extractors (`adm_sycl`, `vif_sycl`, `motion_sycl`, `psnr_sycl`,
  `float_moment_sycl`) and `psnr_hvs_sycl` return `-EIO` for the frame, and the
  CLI stops with an error after a line such as
  `libvmaf ERROR SYCL graph wait: level_zero backend failed with error: 20
  (UR_RESULT_ERROR_DEVICE_LOST)`. Before, the graph extractors emitted scores
  for the faulted frame from stale buffers (about 1.0 for every ADM scale);
  only a later frame's upload noticed the fault, so a one-frame run exited 0.

`psnr_hvs_sycl` returns the CPU `psnr_hvs` scores bit for bit, at every frame
size and at 8 to 12 bits
([ADR-1401](../../adr/1401-psnr-hvs-sycl-hip-exact-twins.md)). The CPU
accumulates all per-coefficient errors of a plane in one `float`, so its score
depends on the order of the additions; the kernel stores the 64 terms of every
block and the host adds them in the CPU's order.

The CPU takes its masking threshold as a `float` product whose square root is
taken in `double` ([ADR-1488](../../adr/1488-psnr-hvs-upstream-mask-product.md);
this entry first said `double` product); the kernel, which has no fp64, gets the
same `float` from an integer square root of the exact product. The cross-backend
gate compares this twin with tolerance 0 ([the gate
guide](../../development/cross-backend-gate.md)).

The price is a readback of 256 bytes per block (65 MB per 3840x2160 frame) and a
sequential host sum; see [the psnr_hvs
page](../../metrics/psnr-hvs.md#gpu-twins) for the
timings. Before, the twin summed per block and was up to 1.1e-2 dB from the CPU
at 3840x2160 (8.4e-5 at 576x324), under a tolerance that grew with the frame
size ([ADR-1361](../../adr/1361-psnr-hvs-area-scaled-parity-tolerance.md)).
4:0:0 input is scored on luma only, as on the CPU.

## CAMBI reads its device buffers in one copy (2026-09-17)

!!! note
    Superseded: since [ADR-1357](../../adr/1357-sycl-cambi-device-resident.md)
    the twin runs every stage on the device and reads back one 88-byte block
    per frame, so it no longer copies these buffers.

`integer_cambi_sycl.cpp` enqueued one `q.memcpy` per row when reading the
decimated image and mask back for the CPU residual. Both sides are packed at
the same pitch, so the region was already contiguous and the loop bought
nothing: it is now a single copy per buffer.

The CUDA twin carried a worse version of the same defect — a *blocking* copy per
row, which cost 0.602 s of a 1.03 s run over 48 frames of 1080p. See
[the CUDA overview](../cuda/overview.md)
for the measurements. **If you add a GPU twin that reads a plane back, copy it
in one transfer.**

## SpEED-chroma reports singularity separately from failure (ADR-1202, 2026-09-06)

The SYCL SpEED-chroma twin previously treated any non-zero return from its
linear-algebra helper as "singular covariance matrix" and imputed the `uv`
score from the other chroma channel. That rule is correct for the CPU
extractor, where a non-zero return does mean singular, but not here: this twin
handles singularity internally (warn, zero the solution, return 0) and uses
the return value for API errors only. A real device error was therefore fed
into the imputation, and with both chroma channels failing it averaged to
`0.0` and reported success.

Singularity now travels in its own `bool *singular_out` and hard errors
propagate, so a device failure inside SpEED-chroma fails the frame instead of
emitting a `0.0` score. The twin also adopts the CPU rule that a channel with
exactly one singular side (reference or distorted) scores 0 rather than an
inflated value. The launch-geometry half of ADR-1202 was CUDA-only — this
twin's solve launch was already correct.

## `integer_adm_sycl` and the default model's ADM (2026-09-05)

The default model `vmaf_v1.0.16_3d0h` requests
`VMAF_integer_feature_adm3_score` with `adm_csf_mode=2`,
`adm_dlm_weight=0.7`, `adm_enhn_gain_limit=1.0`, `adm_min_val=0.5` and
`adm_noise_weight=0.02`, under the key
`integer_adm3_csf_2_dlmw_0.7_egl_1_min_0.5_nw_0.02`.

`integer_adm_sycl` now honours `adm_csf_mode` (all four CSF models) and
`adm_p_norm`, and its `VmafOption` table is an entry-for-entry mirror of the
CPU table, so the `adm2` and `integer_adm_scale*` keys it emits are identical
to the CPU twin's for any options dict.

Two CPU-parity corrections landed with the option work: `adm_min_val` no
longer clamps `adm2` (the CPU floors the adm3 expression only), and the
`numden_limit` precision floor scales with the full-frame area rather than the
scale-3 area.

**`aim_score` and `adm3_score` come from the device (ADR-1362, 2026-09-29).**
Until this change the twin had no AIM pass and left both features to the CPU
`integer_adm` extractor, so under `--backend sycl` the default model scored
ADM on the CPU beside the device VIF, motion and CAMBI. The twin now runs the
CPU's second contrast-masking pass itself: the masking threshold comes from
the CSF-weighted restored signal and the measured signal is the additive
impairment, the two roles swapped relative to the DLM pass. It shares one
reduction kernel with the DLM measure and the CSF denominator, and the
accumulators still come back in one small copy per frame. To see the two
features from the twin itself, name it:
`vmaf -r ref.yuv -d dis.yuv -w 576 -h 324 -p 420 -b 8 --backend sycl
--feature adm_sycl --no_prediction --json -o out.json` lists `integer_aim` and
`integer_adm3` next to `integer_adm2`.

How close the twin's ADM features are to `--backend cpu`, measured at
`--precision max` on an Arc B580 and a UHD 770 (Netflix `src01` pair, 50
frames of Big Buck Bunny 3840x2160, 853x480 and 17x17 crops, 10-bit input):

| Feature | Difference from the CPU extractor |
| --- | --- |
| `integer_aim`, `integer_adm3`, `integer_adm2`, `integer_adm_scale0..3` | none: bit-identical on every frame |
| any of them with a non-integer `adm_enhn_gain_limit` (e.g. 1.2) | up to 1.4e-6, from the fixed-point gain limit; the shipped models use 1.0 or 100 |

Before this change adm2 and the scale outputs were up to 2.9e-7 from the CPU
(the twin finalised its sums in double where the CPU uses float), and
`integer_adm_scale2` up to 1.40e-6 on 4K content.

Default model, milliseconds per frame, before this change → after (median of
seven runs at 576x324 and three at 3840x2160; `--threads 0` is the CLI
default, under which a CPU extractor runs on the main thread):

| Size | `--threads` | Arc B580 | UHD 770 | CPU backend |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 576x324 | 0 | 2.80 → 2.83 | 9.32 → 10.78 | — |
| 576x324 | 16 | 2.14 → 3.01 | 8.51 → 10.97 | 0.73 → 0.62 |
| 3840x2160 | 0 | 48.4 → 9.2 | 75.7 → 87.5 | — |
| 3840x2160 | 16 | 24.3 → 9.7 | 40.5 → 79.4 | 32.1 → 26.5 |

On the B580 a 4K frame is now 2.5 to 5 times faster and no longer depends on
`--threads`. On the UHD 770 the default model gets slower, most of all with
`--threads 16`: the CPU used to compute ADM for several frames in parallel with
the iGPU, and now the iGPU does that work as well. SYCL on the UHD 770 stays
slower than the CPU backend either way.

At 576x324 the B580 numbers are within the run-to-run spread. The CPU backend
runs the same code in both builds; its spread is load from other jobs on the
machine.

The twin also accepts the CPU's `adm_skip_aim` option (`aim` becomes 0 and the
AIM pass is skipped). The HIP twin still has no AIM pass
(`T-GPU-ADM-AIM-DEVICE-PASS-MISSING-SYCL-HIP-2026-09-05` in
[`state.md`](../../state.md)).

## Sub-group size 8 removed (2026-10-02)

Six kernels required sub-group size 8 until 2026-10-02: the row sums of
`float_motion_sycl`, `float_adm_sycl` and `float_vif_sycl`, the sum walk of
`ssimulacra2_sycl` and two test probes. The default build, which the dev
container image uses, failed from the first of them on, because the Xe2
targets do not compile a kernel that requires 8
([ADR-1468](../../adr/1468-sycl-sub-group-sizes-every-aot-target.md)).

They require 16 now. On an Arc A380 their scores are unchanged bit for bit,
none uses scratch memory, and a 3840x2160 frame takes at most 2 % longer
(`float_motion_sycl` 4.27 ms instead of 4.18). Whether they are scratch-free
and exact at 16 on Xe2 and on integrated GPUs had not been measured
(`T-SYCL-ROW-KERNELS-SG16-OTHER-DEVICES-2026-10-02` in
[`state.md`](../../state.md); the Xe2 half was done on 2026-10-03). A build with
an empty target list had the same defect on an Xe2 device at run time, where
the runtime compiler refuses the kernel.

## AOT images were silently dropped (before ADR-1360)

Before [ADR-1360](../../adr/1360-sycl-aot-compile-time-device-codegen.md) the
link silently dropped the native images and every build was SPIR-V only.
`core/src/sycl/check_aot_image.py` now fails the build when an image is
missing.

## CPU math library of a SYCL build (before ADR-1495)

Before [ADR-1495](../../adr/1495-icx-system-libm.md) the CPU extractors of a
SYCL build called Intel's `log10` and `pow` and could differ from a GCC build
in the last place. Entries of this log that mention Intel's math library in an
icx build describe that state.

## Parity before the exactness work (2026-09-29)

Before the exactness work recorded above, measured with icpx 2026.1 on an Arc
B580 and a UHD 770 on 2026-09-29 (both give the same result except where noted
in the ADR), the maximum absolute difference against
`--backend cpu --precision max` was:

- bit-identical for `motion_v2`, `float_psnr`, `psnr`, `float_moment`,
  `speed_chroma` and `speed_temporal`;
- within 2.2e-15 for `cambi` and 6.7e-12 for `ssimulacra2` (bit-identical since
  ADR-1446);
- between 1e-8 (`ssim`) and 8.4e-4 dB (`psnr_hvs` at 3840x2160) for the others,
  each inside its [cross-backend gate](../../development/cross-backend-gate.md)
  tolerance.

The exception was `float_ssim` forced to `scale=1` at 3840x2160, 8.8e-5 from
the CPU because of a formula difference; with the default automatic scale a 4K
`float_ssim` ran on the CPU extractor. The per-twin table is in
[Research-1367](../../research/1367-sycl-strict-fp-every-feature-tu.md).

On 2026-09-27 the pooled score of the Netflix pair still differed from the CPU
by 2.48e-5. `-fp-model=precise` alone, which earlier guides described as
IEEE-754 strict mode, left `a * b + c` fused and `/` and `sqrt` approximate
(29 % and 8 % of random fp32 operands differ from the host).

## Closed gaps

These items were once listed under Known gaps and are closed.

### CAMBI: the hybrid twin

`cambi_sycl` shipped in ADR-0415 as a Strategy II hybrid: the GPU ran the
spatial mask, the decimation and the mode filter, and the host ran the c-values
and the top-K pooling with a device-to-host copy per scale. Since
[ADR-1357](../../adr/1357-sycl-cambi-device-resident.md) every stage runs on the
device, the distorted plane comes from the shared frame upload and one 88-byte
block is read back per frame. At 3840x2160 a frame takes 9.3 ms on an Arc B580
(it was 140) and 42 ms on a UHD 770 (it was 944).

Until branch `fix/gpu-cambi-parity-drift` the hybrid twin drifted from the CPU
extractor on real content by 2.7e-3 pooled (7.2e-3 max per frame) on the
576x324 `src01` pair. Its spatial-mask kernel clamped out-of-image neighbours
where `cambi.c` zero-pads them, and its vertical `filter_mode` pass overwrote
the two border rows `cambi.c` deliberately leaves unfiltered. Both were fixed,
and the measured parity was:

| Fixture | Frames | pooled `cambi_hrs_1080_cmxv_17_vlt_0.06` | max per-frame CPU to SYCL delta |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `src01` 576x324 | 48 | 0.2596781483085728 (CPU and SYCL) | 0 |
| Tennis 1920x1080 | 10 | 0.5670459080762581 (CPU and SYCL) | 0 |
| checkerboard 1px / 10px 1920x1080 | 3 each | 0 (CPU and SYCL) | 0 |

Measured at `--precision max` (`%.17g`) on an Intel Arc A380, before ADR-1357.
Every CAMBI GPU stage was integer-only and the c-value and pooling residual was
the CPU code called through `cambi_internal.h`, which is why the emitted score
agreed to every printed digit. This is a measurement on these four fixtures,
not a general bit-exactness guarantee for the SYCL backend (see
[ADR-0214](../../adr/0214-gpu-parity-ci-gate.md) for the tolerance contract).
In that CAMBI measurement pooled `vmaf` still differed by 2.2e-6 on `src01`
because the ADM, VIF and motion twins carried their own deltas.

### GPU twins reached only through a model

Until [ADR-1359](../../adr/1359-cli-feature-backend-twin.md), `--feature <name>`
resolved through `vmaf_get_feature_extractor_by_name()`, a plain name match on
the registry, so `--backend sycl --feature cambi` ran the CPU `cambi` extractor.
Only a model's feature list, resolved through
`vmaf_get_feature_extractor_by_feature_name(name, flags)`, picked the `_sycl`
twin (ADR-1100), and a twin could
otherwise be named only through the C API
(`vmaf_use_feature(vmaf, "cambi_sycl", NULL)`). Since ADR-1359 an explicit
device `--backend` runs the CPU extractor name on that backend's twin when the
twin can honour the options and size.

### CIEDE2000: chroma upload

`ciede_sycl` uploads the luma and both chroma planes at their native size and
the kernel reads chroma at the subsampled position (the CUDA and HIP twins
index the same way). The host no longer upscales chroma to full resolution
before the copy, which roughly halves the per-frame time at 4K on an Arc B580.
Since ADR-1436 the scores are within 1.4e-11 of the CPU `ciede`.

### SSIM family and float twins

SYCL twins exist for `integer_ssim`, `float_ssim`, `float_ms_ssim`, `psnr` and
`psnr_hvs`, and the float twins cover PSNR, motion, VIF and ADM
([ADR-0202](../../adr/0202-float-adm-cuda-sycl.md)). `float_ansnr` was removed
([ADR-0865](../../adr/0865-ansnr-sunset-pre-vmaf-metric-drop.md)).

### Motion options from the upstream port

The `float_motion` options `motion_add_scale1`, `motion_add_uv`,
`motion_filter_size`, `motion_max_val` and `motion3_score` came in with the
upstream port of Netflix/vmaf
[`b949cebf`](https://github.com/Netflix/vmaf/commit/b949cebf) (2026-04-29). With
T3-15(c) ([ADR-0219](../../adr/0219-motion3-gpu-coverage.md)) the SYCL
`integer_motion` extractor emitted `motion3_score` in 3-frame window mode
through host-side `motion_blend()` post-processing of `motion2_score`, and the
full options surface (`motion_blend_factor`, `motion_blend_offset`,
`motion_fps_weight`, `motion_max_val`, `motion_moving_average`) was exposed.
`motion_max_val` is honoured on both `integer_motion2` and `integer_motion3`
scores, which removed drift on high-motion content such as 1080p checkerboard
pairs.

The SYCL `picture_copy()` call sites in
[`integer_ms_ssim_sycl.cpp`](../../../core/src/feature/sycl/integer_ms_ssim_sycl.cpp)
and
[`integer_ssim_sycl.cpp`](../../../core/src/feature/sycl/integer_ssim_sycl.cpp)
pass `0` for the trailing `channel` argument added by
the port (Y plane only, preserving the earlier SYCL behaviour).

### SSIMULACRA 2

`ssimulacra2_sycl` shipped per
[ADR-0206](../../adr/0206-ssimulacra2-cuda-sycl.md) and has been
device-resident since
[ADR-1363](../../adr/1363-sycl-ssimulacra2-msssim-device-resident.md): one
upload of the raw planes, colour conversion, XYB, blurs, SSIM and edge sums and
downsample on the device, one 864-byte readback per frame. Everything up to the
sums was bit-identical to the CPU, and with
[ADR-1446](../../adr/1446-sycl-ssimulacra2-cpu-bits.md) the sums are too;
before, pairs of floats in a fixed tree put the score within about 1e-11 of
`--backend cpu`.

The Charalampidis recursive blur is pure float32. Pseudo-Kahan recurrence
attempts are forbidden: the 3-pole IIR filter has no running accumulator and
diverges exponentially when perturbed. The places=1 (`5.0e-2`) Arc A380
calibration of
[ADR-0985](../../adr/0985-sycl-parity-divergence-2026-06-03.md) predated the
device-resident chain and was removed.

### MS-SSIM waits once per frame

`float_ms_ssim_sycl` enqueues the pyramid and every scale's passes in
`submit()`, each scale writing its partials to its own span, and `collect()`
waits once and sums them (ADR-1363). Since ADR-1414 the twin computes the CPU's
arithmetic and its per-scale means equal the CPU's.

### SpEED twins

`speed_chroma_sycl` and `speed_temporal_sycl` became device-resident and
bit-identical to the CPU with
[ADR-1358](../../adr/1358-sycl-speed-device-resident-linalg.md). The pipeline
rounds division and square root explicitly (`div_rn()` / `sqrt_rn()`) and keeps
every product that feeds an add in a named temporary. It was written before
every SYCL feature translation unit got contraction off and correctly rounded
division (ADR-1367) and stays exact whatever the compile line.

### Older fp64 notes

Until ADR-1413 the ADM gain limit was a Q31 fixed-point product, up to one off
per sample for a non-integer gain. A previous WARNING-level init line ("using
int64 emulation for gain limiting") suggested an emulation-overhead fallback
that never existed; it was removed.
