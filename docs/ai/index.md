# Tiny AI

Tiny AI is the part of VMAFx that runs small ONNX perceptual-quality models next
to the classic VMAF SVM. A tiny model can replace or augment the SVM score
(full-reference), score a clip without a reference, or filter frames before
encoding. libvmaf stays C-only: models run through ONNX Runtime, and training
lives in the Python package [`ai/`](../../ai/).

## Run a shipped model

You need a libvmaf build with ONNX Runtime (`-Denable_dnn=enabled`, or `auto`
with ONNX Runtime found by `pkg-config`). `--tiny-model` takes the path of an
`.onnx` file, not a registry id. Models ship under
[`model/tiny/`](../../model/tiny/).

```bash
vmaf -r ref.yuv -d dis.yuv -w 576 -h 324 -p 420 -b 8 \
     --tiny-model model/tiny/vmaf_tiny_v2.onnx \
     --json -o scores.json
```

The tiny score is an ordinary per-frame feature in the output. It is named after
the `name` field of the model's sidecar JSON, or `vmaf_tiny_model` when the
sidecar has no `name`. Look for it in `frames[].metrics` and `pooled_metrics`
next to `vmaf`. Full details, flags and caveats are in
[inference.md](inference.md).

!!! note
    Models that read libvmaf features (the `vmaf_tiny_*` and `fr_regressor_*`
    families) make the run compute them, and their scores appear once the run
    has read its last frame. The codec-aware `fr_regressor_v2` and
    `fr_regressor_v3` also need `--tiny-codec` and `--tiny-crf`
    ([inference](inference.md#codec-aware-models)).

## Status

The shipped models were trained against the `vmaf_v0.6.1` teacher, and
[`model/tiny/registry.json`](../../model/tiny/registry.json) lists 26 entries,
13 of them smoke fixtures that exercise the loader and are not quality models.
The one-shot retrain against the `vmaf_v1.0.16_3d0h` teacher is RC9 work, see
the [roadmap](../roadmap.md) and the [retrain runbook](retrain-runbook-1246.md).
Treat accuracy numbers as pre-retrain.
