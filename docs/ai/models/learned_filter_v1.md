# `learned_filter_v1` — tiny residual luma filter

`learned_filter_v1` is a self-supervised residual convolutional neural
network that maps a degraded luma frame to a clean reconstruction. It
serves as the C3 baseline for the fork's tiny-AI filter capability
([ADR-0020](../../adr/0020-tinyai-four-capabilities.md)), exercising the
full training + export + quantisation pipeline end-to-end.

> **Status — shipped 2026-04-25.** Production baseline for the C3 filter
> capability (KoNViD-1k self-supervised). An INT8 sidecar is available via
> `learned_filter_v1.int8.onnx` (dynamic-PTQ). See
> [ADR-0168](../../adr/0168-tinyai-konvid-baselines.md) and
> [ADR-0174](../../adr/0174-first-model-quantisation.md).

## What the output means

The model takes a degraded luma frame (blurred + JPEG-compressed) and
produces a residual-corrected clean luma estimate. The output is the
**reconstructed luma tensor** on the same scale as the input; it is not
a quality score. Downstream consumers subtract the output from the input
to obtain the learned residual correction, or pass it directly to a
downstream feature extractor.

Fresh exports from `ai/scripts/export_tiny_models.py` add ADR-0661
`run_provenance` to `model/tiny/learned_filter_v1.json`. That block records
the C3 checkpoint input, parsed exporter arguments, ONNX output, sidecar
output, and registry target so a refreshed filter baseline can be replayed.

## Training corpus provenance

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Dataset | KoNViD-1k |
| Source | <http://database.mmsp-kn.de/konvid-1k-database.html> |
| Terms | No licence named: the database page says KoNViD-1k "is freely available to the research community" (read 2026-10-04); its clips are YFCC100M videos under assorted Creative Commons licences. Clips are not redistributed in-tree; the terms and the fork's reading are under [Training data terms](#training-data-terms). |
| Usage | Middle frame extracted per clip; synthetic degradation applied (Gaussian blur σ=1.2 + JPEG quality=35); self-supervised (degraded→clean pairs, no external MOS labels used for the filter task) |

**Acknowledgement.** Training uses KoNViD-1k frames for self-supervised
degradation recovery. The clips are not committed to this repository.

## Training data terms

This model was trained on KoNViD-1k frames. The terms below are quoted as each
source states them (read 2026-10-04); the [dataset
terms](../training-data.md#dataset-terms) list where each comes from and which
models it trained.

**KoNViD-1k**:
<http://database.mmsp-kn.de/konvid-1k-database.html>

> KoNViD-1k is freely available to the research community.
>
> We took YFCC100m as a baseline database, consisting of 793436 Creative Commons
> (CC) video sequences

The page names no licence and offers the database to the research community;
each clip keeps the Creative Commons licence of its YFCC100M upload.

**Reading.** The fork ships these weights under BSD-2-Clause-Patent: they are
fitted parameters that cannot reproduce a clip, an image or a label, and no
dataset file is redistributed. That is the fork's reading, not a permission
from the dataset's authors. Where a dataset limits its use to research and
that limit binds the weights where you use them, treat the model as
research-only.

**Retrain.** RC9 retrains this model on data cleared for redistribution
(`T-TINY-AI-RETRAIN-CLEARED-DATA-2026-10-04` in [state](../../state.md);
[ADR-1490](../../adr/1490-rc3-rc9-candidate-map-cpu-capability.md),
[ADR-1570](../../adr/1570-tiny-model-dataset-terms-retrain-rc9.md)).

## Op-allowlist conformance

Every op in the graph is on
[`core/src/dnn/op_allowlist.c`](../../../core/src/dnn/op_allowlist.c):
`Conv`, `Relu`, `Add` (residual skip connection) and `Clip`.

## Degradation recipe

The synthetic training pairs are produced inside `export_tiny_models.py`:

1. Load middle frame of each KoNViD-1k clip as 224×224 grayscale
   (nearest-neighbour crop; no random augment at export time).
2. Apply Gaussian blur with σ=1.2.
3. JPEG-compress at quality 35 using `PIL.Image.save(..., quality=35)`.
4. Luma pair: (degraded, original) both normalised to `[0, 1]`.

## Usage — `vmaf_pre` FFmpeg filter

The `vmaf_pre` filter of `ffmpeg-patches/0002` loads this model through its
`model` option (`device`, `threads` and `chroma` are the other options):

```bash
ffmpeg \
  -i dist.yuv -i ref.yuv \
  -filter_complex '[0:v]vmaf_pre=model=model/tiny/learned_filter_v1.onnx[d];
                   [d][1:v]libvmaf' \
  -f null -
```

The filter applies the model to the distorted stream's luma before VMAF
scoring, enabling a learned pre-processing step upstream of the feature
extractors.

## Reproducing the model

1. Fetch KoNViD-1k (~40 GB; not redistributed in-tree):

   ```bash
   .venv/bin/python ai/scripts/fetch_konvid_1k.py
   ```

2. Train the C2/C3 checkpoints. A run-provenance sidecar is written
   automatically to `runs/c2_konvid/train_konvid.manifest.json` (ADR-0668);
   pass `--manifest-out <path>` to override its location:

   ```bash
   .venv/bin/python ai/scripts/train_konvid.py \
       --model both \
       --output-c2 runs/c2_konvid \
       --output-c3 runs/c3_konvid \
       --epochs-c2 50 \
       --epochs-c3 200 \
       --seed 42
   ```

3. Export the ONNX, sidecar and registry rows:

   ```bash
   .venv/bin/python ai/scripts/export_tiny_models.py \
       --c2-ckpt runs/c2_konvid/last.ckpt \
       --c3-ckpt runs/c3_konvid/last.ckpt
   ```

4. Quantise to INT8 (the fp32 ONNX path is a positional argument):

   ```bash
   .venv/bin/python ai/scripts/ptq_dynamic.py model/tiny/learned_filter_v1.onnx \
       --output model/tiny/learned_filter_v1.int8.onnx
   ```

5. Validate against the registry:

   ```bash
   .venv/bin/python ai/scripts/validate_model_registry.py
   ```

## Known limitations

- **Task scope**: the degradation recipe (Gaussian blur + JPEG) covers
  classic codec artefacts but not block noise patterns typical of
  AVC/HEVC at very low bitrate or content-adaptive quantisation.
- **Luma only**: the filter operates on the Y channel. Chroma artefacts
  (colour bleed, cross-component leakage) are not corrected.
- **Fixed crop**: training used fixed 224×224 frames (see the degradation
  recipe); inference is
  fully convolutional (no size constraint), but quality on very large or
  very small inputs may degrade.
- **Self-supervised only**: no perceptual loss (LPIPS, SSIM); the L1
  reconstruction target may slightly over-smooth texture.
