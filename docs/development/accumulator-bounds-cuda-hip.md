# Accumulator bounds: CUDA and HIP

Appendix of [integer accumulator bounds](accumulator-bounds.md): every integer accumulator, size product and offset of the CUDA and HIP feature twins, read on master `571565a47` (before the fixes the main page lists). Rows marked OVERFLOW or DEPENDS name their state row on the main page.

- Source: master `571565a47`.
- Mode: read only. Nothing was edited, built or run on a device. The only commands were `grep`, `sed` and `cat`, plus a few `python3` bound computations. The ADM replay is `scripts/dev/adm_cm_row_bound.py`.
- Scope:
  - every file under `core/src/feature/cuda/` and `core/src/feature/hip/` (130 files);
  - the shared `core/src/feature/*.h` headers those files include for GPU-side integer math;
  - `core/src/cuda/*.c`, `core/src/hip/*.c` and `core/src/cuda/cuda_helper.cuh`, for size products only.
- Envelope:
  - 16K: W ≤ 15360, H ≤ 8640, N = 132,710,400.
  - 8K DCI: 8192x4320.
  - Cap: W, H ≤ 32768, N ≤ 2^30.
  - Samples up to 16 bit, 4:4:4.
  - Worst-case content: max-difference frames or constructed extremal patterns.

## How the audit was done

The audit was split into eight feature groups. Each group read every file of its group in full and derived every bound from the code it read. Each group reports its own constants and derivations. Every row that is not SAFE was then re-checked every row that is not SAFE against the source, and spot-checked a set of SAFE rows (listed at the end of this section).

- Feature sections: every feature has CUDA and HIP subsections.
- Integer ADM is the exception. Its HIP kernels are line-for-line ports of the CUDA kernels, so each ADM row cites both files and is tagged "CUDA …; HIP …".
- Rows on shared headers sit in their own subsection of the feature that uses them.

## Verdict totals (743 rows)

| verdict | rows |
|---|---|
| SAFE | 730 |
| OVERFLOW@16K | 2 |
| OVERFLOW@CAP-ONLY | 3 |
| DEPENDS | 8 |

Two verdicts changed from the first draft, both in integer ADM:
- **Scale-0 CM row total: DEPENDS → OVERFLOW@16K.** The envelope covers every W ≤ 15360, and W = 63–64 wraps at default options.
- **Scale-0 CM frame accumulator: DEPENDS → SAFE.** The frame sum cannot wrap for any int64 row value.

## Every row that is not SAFE

### OVERFLOW@16K

1. \*\*Integer ADM decouple, scales 1-3: double → int32 out of range (CUDA and HIP).\*\*
   - Location: `cuda/integer_adm/adm_decouple_inline.cuh:160`, `hip/integer_adm/adm_decouple_inline.hip:163`.
   - Expression: `int32_t rst = (int32_t)(((k * o_val) + 16384) >> 15) * adm_enhn_gain_limit;`
   - The `(int32_t)` cast binds to the shifted product only. The multiplication by the `double` gain yields a `double`, which is implicitly converted to `int32_t` \*before\* `min(rst, t_val)` / `max(rst, t_val)`.
   - Bound: |r| ≤ |o| ≤ 1.449e9 at scale 1 and ≤ 7.5e8 at scales 2-3. Those are the DWT band maxima; they agree with `adm_csf_fixed_point.h:88-90`.
   - The default gain is 100 (`adm_options.h:40`). With angle_flag set, |r| > 21,474,837 produces a `double` outside the int32 range, which is UB under C++ [conv.fpint].
   - This does not depend on frame size. It needs only a band value above about 1.5 % of the scale-1 maximum and a dis band within 1° of the ref band, which is ordinary content on high-quality encodes.
   - The CPU (`integer_adm_kernels.h:380-385`) takes `MIN(rst * gain, t)` in double first, which is defined.
   - The GPU scores match the CPU only because the hardware conversions saturate: `INT32_MAX` gives `min(INT32_MAX, t) = t`. This is consistent with the existing bit-exact parity results, but it is not guaranteed under LLVM (`fptosi` out of range is poison).
   - Fix: `rst = (int32_t)fmin((double)r * gain, (double)t)` and the mirrored `fmax`, as the CPU does.
2. \*\*Integer ADM scale-0 contrast-masking row total, int64 (CUDA, HIP, and the CPU reference).\*\*
   - Locations:
     - CUDA `adm_cm.cu:561, 894` (`accum_row`), `:515` (`warp_reduce`), `:519`.
     - HIP `adm_cm.hip:440, 719`, `:457`, `:465`.
     - CPU `integer_adm_kernels.h:1017-1019, 1079-1099`.
   - Term: `((x² + 2^28) >> 29) · x >> (ceil(log2 Wb) − 4)`, where Wb = W/2. The shift uses the band width (`integer_adm.c:711` passes `w2`; `integer_adm_kernels.h:989`).
   - Worst case: ref == dis, so a = 0 and thr = 0, and x = |band| · weight. With 4 pixel rows (0, 0, max, 0), the exact column-sign maximum comes from the DP in `scripts/dev/adm_cm_row_bound.py`. It was re-run for this page.
   - Row maximum as a fraction of INT64_MAX at the default Watson weights:

     | W | row max / INT64_MAX |
     |---|---|
     | 48 | 0.807 |
     | 56 | 0.878 |
     | \*\*64\*\* | \*\*1.021 (wraps)\*\* |
     | 128 | 0.973 |
     | 1080p (1920) | 0.857 |
     | 8K DCI | 0.912 |
     | 15360 | 0.855 |
     | 16384 | 0.912 |
     | cap | 0.912 |

   - The 8-bit maximum at W = 64 is 1.009 and the 10-bit maximum is 1.018.
   - W ≥ 17 is accepted (`ADM_MIN_FRAME_DIM`, `adm_csf_fixed_point.h:277`), so W = 63–64 runs.
   - With non-default CSF weights the row also overflows at 16K and at the cap: h/v ≥ 38,406 or d ≥ 60,965 at 16K, h/v ≥ 37,588 at the cap. Those weights are reachable through `adm_csf_scale` / `adm_csf_diag_scale` / the viewing-geometry options.
   - The bound is not monotonic in W, because the normalising shift is ceil(log2 Wb).
   - The CPU has the same signed int64 sum, so all backends share the defect: signed-overflow UB on the CPU, and a two's-complement wrap on the GPUs.

### OVERFLOW@CAP-ONLY

3. \*\*HIP PSNR-HVS prefix scan silently stops at 32,768 chunks (`hip/integer_psnr_hvs/psnr_hvs_score.hip:462-471`).**
   - Code: `limit = num_chunks < 32768u ? num_chunks : 32768u`.
   - num_chunks = ceil(total_blocks / 256), and total_blocks = Σ planes ((w−8)/7+1)·((h−8)/7+1) (`integer_psnr_hvs_hip.c:389-393`).
   - 16K 4:4:4: 3 · 2194 · 1234 = 8,122,188 blocks, so 31,728 chunks. That is under the cap, with a 3.2 % margin.
   - The cap is passed above 8,388,608 blocks, for example:
     - 16384x8640 4:4:4: 8,662,680 blocks.
     - luma-only frames above about 20.3K x 20.3K.
     - cap 4:4:4: 256,779 chunks.
   - Above that, `chunk_offsets[c ≥ 32768]` are never written. `d_scratch` is a `hipMalloc` buffer that is never cleared, so `hvs_compact_hip` writes `packed_terms + chunk_offsets[chunk] + intra` from stale or garbage offsets. The results are out-of-bounds device writes, a short `total_terms`, and wrong scores.
   - The CUDA twin (`psnr_hvs_score.cu:443`) scans every chunk.
   - The `uint32_t` sum itself is safe: ≤ 4,207,058,112 at the cap.
4. \*\*CUDA SpEED covariance divisor rounded to fp32 (`cuda/speed/speed_score.cu:1219`).**
   - Code: `static_cast<float>(g.sub_w * g.sub_h)`.
   - This is not a wrap: the `uint32_t` product is at most 67,010,596. The problem is the fp32 exact-integer range, 2^24.
   - The count is exact at 16K for every option value: the largest is 3836 · 2156 = 8,270,416 at `speed_prescale` 4.
   - Above 16K with a prescale above about 2, the count can be inexact. For example, W = H = 32740 at prescale 4 gives sub 8181, and 8181² = 66,928,761 is odd and above 2^24.
   - The CPU (`speed.c:847`) divides the double sum by the exact double count. The twin is then no longer bit-exact.
   - The mean divisor (`:1183`) rounds the count the same way the CPU's `compute_mean` (`speed.c:775`) does, so it is SAFE.
5. \*\*HIP SpEED covariance divisor (`hip/speed/speed_hip_device.h:624`).\*\* Same defect as row 4.

### DEPENDS

6. \*\*CUDA integer PSNR clip-level `apsnr_sse[p] += sse` (`cuda/integer_psnr_cuda.c:394`), `uint64_t`.**
   - One plane's frame SSE ≤ N · 65535² per frame.
   - Frames to wrap at 16-bit max-diff:

     | resolution | frames to wrap |
     |---|---|
     | 1080p | 2,072 |
     | 8K DCI | 122 |
     | 16K | 33 |
     | cap | 5 |

   - These come from 2^64 / (N · 4,294,836,225) = 2071.4, 121.4, 32.4 and 4.0.
   - At 12 bit the counts are 530,502 / 31,085 / 8,290 / 1,025.
   - At 10 bit they are 8.5M / 498,076 / 132,821 / 16,417.
   - At 8 bit they are 136.8M / 8.0M / 2.1M / 264,205.
   - The wrap is silent, and apsnr comes out too high. CPU `integer_psnr.c` uses the same `uint64_t`.
7. \*\*HIP integer PSNR `apsnr_sse[p] += sse` (`hip/integer_psnr_hip.c:476`).\*\* Same as row 6.
8. \*\*HIP float PSNR 16bpc kernel at bpc 10/12 (`hip/float_psnr/float_psnr_score.hip:151,161,166`), `uint32_t` block sum of 256 float squares.**
   - In-range samples give 256 · 4095² = 4,292,870,400, which is 2,096,895 below UINT32_MAX.
   - uint16 codewords above 2^bpc − 1 can wrap the sum. Nothing in `picture.c` / `libvmaf.c` checks samples against bpc.
   - At 16 bit the kernel splits each square into 16-bit halves, so that case is safe.
9. \*\*HIP integer VIF horizontal `accum_mu1/mu2 += coeff * tmp.mu1[...]`, `uint32_t` (`hip/integer_vif/vif_statistics.hip:499-500, 530-534`).**
   - The HIP vertical pass stores `tmp.mu1` without the `(uint16_t)` truncation that the CPU (`integer_vif.c:450-451`) and CUDA (`filter1d.cu:603-604`) apply.
   - For bpc 9-15 with samples above 2^bpc − 1, the stored value reaches 8,388,480, and the 17-tap sum reaches 5.5e11. That wraps, and HIP then differs from the CPU.
   - In-range samples are SAFE: ≤ 4,294,901,760.
10. \*\*HIP integer VIF `vif_downsample_store` `accum_ref_rd` (`hip/integer_vif/vif_statistics.hip:506-507, 329-336`).\*\* Same cause as row 9: `ref_convol` is not truncated.
11. \*\*CUDA motion batch-boundary frame counter (`cuda/integer_motion_cuda.c:830`, `:533-534`, `:545`).**
    - Code: `last_batch_boundary = (int)index`.
    - Index 2^31 − 1 ≡ 7 (mod 8) is a boundary, so `last_batch_boundary + 1` is signed overflow (UB) at the flush.
    - Beyond 2^31, `(int)index` is an implementation-defined narrowing.
    - It needs ≥ 2,147,483,647 frames: 414 days at 60 fps.
12. \*\*Integer ADM `flt = (4369·|i16| + 2048) >> 12` narrowed to int16 (CUDA and HIP).**
    - Locations: CUDA `adm_csf.cu:171`, `adm_cm.cu:844-847`; HIP `adm_csf.hip:193`, `adm_cm.hip:658`.
    - It wraps negative once |i16| ≥ 30,720, which needs an h/v CSF weight ≥ 43,900. The default is 36,453, which gives at most 27,212.
    - The CPU (`integer_adm_kernels.h:488-489`) narrows the same way.
    - It depends on options, not on frame size.
13. \*\*Integer ADM scale-0 `x_sq = (int32_t)((x*x + 2^28) >> 29)` (CUDA `adm_cm.cu:218`, HIP `adm_cm.hip:150`).**
    - SAFE while thr ≥ 0.
    - It wraps only when row 12's negative int16 makes thr negative, so it also depends on options.

## Asides (not integer overflow; found during the reading, worth a ticket)

- **A1 (CUDA `float_motion`, out-of-bounds read): verified.**
  - `fm_mirror()` (`cuda/float_motion/float_motion_score.cu:43-50`) reflects once without a clamp.
  - `fm_load_tile()` (`:85-90`) loads the full 20x20 tile for every block. For W or H in {3..9, 17}, an index goes negative (down to −13) and the load reads before the plane.
  - The HIP twin and the CUDA motion SAD kernels clamp through `vmaf_*_tile_index()`.
- **A2 (CUDA integer VIF, full-mask shuffle inside a divergent branch).**
  - `vif_hori_flush_accums()` → `warp_reduce()` runs `__shfl_down_sync(0xffffffff, …)` under `if (y < h && x_start < w)` (`cuda/integer_vif/filter1d.cu`, the kernel body around :513-535).
  - Lanes past the plane edge do not take part, which is undefined for a full mask.
  - The code shape is verified. The effect on hardware is not.
- **A3 (`core/src/cuda/cuda_helper.cuh:129-130`).\*\* `(x >> 32) << 32` on a negative `long long` is UB before C++20.
- **A4 (stale comments).** `hip/float_psnr/float_psnr_score.hip:107-111,139-141` describe a `partials[2*block]` layout, but the code writes one u64 per block.
- **A5 (outside scope, CPU).**
  - `third_party/xiph/psnr_hvs.c:311-317`: the `int` index reaches exactly INT_MAX for a >8-bit 32768² plane.
  - `integer_motion.c:193/243`: the `uint32_t row_sad` wraps for out-of-range samples (bpc 9, W ≥ 513).
  - `sycl/speed_sycl_pipeline.cpp:808`: the same fp32 covariance divisor as rows 4-5.
- **A6 (memory footprint only, no wrap).**
  - HIP integer ADM `tmp_accum` takes 24 B/pixel: 3.2 GB at 16K and 25.8 GB at the cap.
  - CUDA `vif_cuda` allocates 7 planes that no kernel reads: 3.2e9 B at 16K.
  - The integer SSIM twins need 7 · 2^33 B at the cap.
  - SpEED at prescale 4 needs about 34 GB at 16K.
  - Every one of these is a `size_t` product, so allocation fails cleanly.
- **Common root of rows 8-10.** No libvmaf entry point checks that samples are ≤ 2^bpc − 1. The CPU truncates or uses wide types in places where HIP does not.

## Verification log

- **Row 1:**
  - Read `adm_decouple_inline.cuh:125-170` and `adm_decouple_inline.hip:150-170`.
  - Read the CPU `integer_adm_kernels.h:355-385`.
  - Confirmed the gain default 100.0 at `adm_options.h:40`.
- **Row 2:**
  - Re-ran `scripts/dev/adm_cm_row_bound.py`; the output is the table in row 2.
  - Confirmed the term and shifts: `adm_cm.cu:216-220`, `:500-561`; `integer_adm_kernels.h:989-1003`.
  - Confirmed the band width `w2` (`integer_adm.c:711`) and the minimum frame size 17 (`adm_csf_fixed_point.h:277`).
  - For the frame accumulator: region rows ≤ 0.875 · 2^ceil(log2 Hb), with the maximum at Hb = 16 or 32. So |Σ (row >> s)| < 0.875 · 2^63 for any int64 row value.
- **Row 3:**
  - Read `psnr_hvs_score.hip:430-526` and `integer_psnr_hvs_hip.c:169-189`, `:375-394`.
  - Recomputed the 16K block and chunk counts.
- **Rows 4-5:**
  - Read `speed_score.cu:1175-1222` and `speed_hip_device.h:545-628`.
  - Read the CPU `speed.c:766-776`, `:835-850`, `:1285-1317`, and the option range `speed.c:1518-1523` (`speed_prescale` 0.1..4.0).
  - Recomputed sub at 16K at prescale 4: 3836 x 2156.
  - Found that 32768 at prescale 4 gives 8186² = 67,010,596, which is a multiple of 4 and so exact in fp32. Only some sizes above 2^24 are inexact, for example 32740.
- **Rows 6-8:**
  - Read `integer_psnr_cuda.c:380-400`, the `apsnr_sse` sites in both twins, and `float_psnr_score.hip:1-181`.
  - Recomputed the wrap frames.
- **Rows 9-10:** read `vif_statistics.hip:455-540` against `filter1d.cu:585-612`.
- **Row 11:** read `integer_motion_cuda.c:525-550`, `:822-831`, and grepped both trees for other `(int)index` narrowings (none).
- **Spot-checked SAFE rows, each read in the source:**
  - CUDA `psnr_score.cu` (uint64 SSE, int64 diff, one atomic per block).
  - CUDA `motion_v2_score.cu`: |h| ≤ 65535; SAD ≤ N · 65535 = 2^46 at the cap.
  - CUDA `moment_score.cu`: u64 sums; ref2 ≤ 2^62 at the cap.
  - SSIMULACRA 2 CUDA `unsigned` index `2u * pixels + i`: ≤ 3 · 2^30 − 1 < 2^32.
  - HIP SpEED `(uint32_t)plane_bytes`: 2^31 at the cap, which fits.
  - CAMBI histogram cells: ≤ 65 · 65.
  - The runtime picture allocators: all `size_t`.

## G1: integer ADM, CUDA and HIP twins (integer-overflow audit)

Repo: master at `571565a47`. All paths are under `core/src/feature/`.
Read-only. Nothing was built or run on a device. The bounds come from the code, the
composite-filter bounds per DWT scale of `core/src/feature/adm_csf_fixed_point.h` (held by
`test_integer_adm_cm_budget`), and `scripts/dev/adm_cm_row_bound.py` (the exact maximum of a scale-0 CM row over every column sign
pattern, found by dynamic programming over the overlapping 4-tap windows).

Constants used by every row:

- **DWT taps.** lo = {15826, 27411, 7345, -4240} and hi = {-4240, -7345, 27411, -15826}. Each
  has an absolute sum of 54822. The lo taps sum to 46342 (`integer_adm.h:187-191`; the GPU
  copies are in `adm_fixed_parameters()` and `adm_hip_fixed_params()`).
- **Band maxima** (half the absolute sum of the composite filter; they agree with
  `adm_csf_fixed_point.h:88-90`):
  - scale 0: every band ≤ 22,929.8.
  - scale 1: band_a ≤ 1,491,390,732 and h/v/d ≤ 1,448,979,042.
  - scale 2: ≤ 751,510,749.
  - scale 3: ≤ 748,642,077.
  - Every maximum is below INT32_MAX. They are per sample and do not depend on frame size.
- **CSF weight budgets** (ADR-1472, `adm_csf_fixed_point.h:118-127`):
  - scale 0 h/v: < 46,603.4.
  - scale 0 d: < 65,536 (the storage limit).
  - scale 1: < 279,958,309; scale 2: < 539,893,111; scale 3: < 546,406,567.
  - Defaults (Watson97, 3H, 1080): 36,453 for h/v and 49,417 for d (tabulated).
  - The options `adm_csf_mode` and `adm_csf_scale` / `adm_csf_diag_scale` (continuous doubles,
    0..50, applied multiplicatively in `barten_csf_tools.h:159-160`) can place a weight anywhere
    below its budget. So can a non-default `adm_norm_view_dist` or `adm_ref_display_height`.
- **Region.** `cols = Wb - 2*int(0.1*Wb - 0.5)`, where Wb is the band width (W/2 at scale 0).
  - 16K: Wb = 7680, cols = 6146.
  - 8K DCI: Wb = 4096, cols = 3278.
  - cap: Wb = 16384, cols = 13110.
  - Scale-0 rows at 16K: Hb = 4320, so 3458 rows.

## G2 integer-overflow audit: float ADM, float VIF, integer VIF (CUDA + HIP)

Repo: master at `571565a47`. Read-only. Paths below are relative to
`core/src/feature/`.

Envelope: 16K N = 132,710,400 (2^26.98), cap N = 2^30, W,H <= 32768. Samples <= 65535 (bpc 16) and
in range (<= 2^bpc - 1) unless a row says otherwise.

Basis for integer VIF, checked against the CPU reference (`integer_vif.h:39-46`,
`integer_vif.c:175-228, 254-341, 406-456`):

- Every row of `vif_filter1d_table` sums to exactly 65536. Widths are {17, 9, 5, 3}, and the largest
  tap is 43,728 (scale 3 centre). So any tap sum is at most 65536 \* (max input), whatever W and H are.
- Scale-0 vertical shifts at bpc b: `shift_VP = b`, `shift_VP_sq = 2(b-8)`. Scales 1-3 shift by 16.
  The horizontal shift is always 16. The GPU twins copy these values: `integer_vif_cuda.c:572-589` and
  `integer_vif_hip.c:334-341`.
- Inputs to scales 1-3 are the uint16 decimated planes: at most 65,535 for 16-bit input, at most
  65,280 for 8-bit input.
- The int64 accumulators hold the sums of one frame and one scale. They are cleared every frame
  (`integer_vif_cuda.c:811`, `integer_vif_hip.c:689`), so the frame count does not matter.

Asides (CUDA integer VIF, no overflow, no verdict):

- **Possible undefined-behaviour shuffle, unverified.** `filter1d.cu:513/535`: `vif_hori_flush_accums()`
  (`warp_reduce`, `__shfl_down_sync(0xffffffff, …)`) runs only inside `if (y < h && x_start < w)`.
  When the scale width is not a multiple of 64, lanes of the edge warp skip the shuffle that the full
  mask names. The CUDA guide calls this undefined, and the values read from those lanes are
  undefined. This is not an overflow. `test_integer_vif_cpu_cuda_parity` (256x144, so a 32-pixel
  width at scale 3 with 16 active lanes) passes places=4, so current hardware returns benign values.
  It is not checked on a device here.
- **Idle horizontal blocks.** `filter1d_16_grid` (`integer_vif_cuda.c:620`) sets `grid_hori_x = ceil(w/128)`, but a block
  covers 256 pixels (vpt = 2), so about half the x-blocks do nothing. There is no wrap.
- **Unused buffer memory.** `data_sz` also carves 2 stride_16 planes and 5 stride_32 planes (mu1, mu2,
  mu1_32, mu2_32, ref_sq, dis_sq, ref_dis) that no kernel reads. That is about 3.18e9 B at 16K and
  2.58e10 B at cap of device memory, which matters for memory, not for overflow.

never converted to an integer, so they are out of scope. Only index, size and float-to-int math is
listed. The only conversion is `(float)((int32_t)exponent - 127)`.

### float ADM: CUDA (`float_adm_cuda`) and HIP (`float_adm_hip`)

The accumulators are fp32: the per-row sum `fadm_row_sum` and the frame fold `fadm_fold_rows`. They
are never converted to an integer. The device code has no float-to-int conversion; `fadm_abs` is a
bit mask. Integer math is index and size arithmetic only. Band planes at scale 0 are
`half_w0 = (W+1)/2` by `half_h0 = (H+1)/2`, with `buf_stride = (half_w0 + 3) & ~3`.

### Shared derivation: per-pixel motion SAD term

Taps `{3571, 16004, 26386, 16004, 3571}`, sum 65536 = 2^16 (`cuda/integer_motion_v2/motion_v2_score.cu:39`,
`hip/integer_motion_v2/motion_v2_score.hip:67`, identical to CPU `integer_motion.h:26`). CPU reference
`integer_motion.c:164-257` (pipeline_8 / pipeline_16): vertical shift `bpc`, round `2^(bpc-1)`; horizontal
shift 16, round 2^15. Twins copy it exactly.

- diff `d = prev - cur`: |d| <= 2^bpc - 1 for in-range samples, <= 65535 for any uint16 sample.
- vertical `v = (sum f_k d_k + 2^(bpc-1)) >> bpc`: |sum| <= 65536 \* |d|max.
  In range: |v| <= floor(65536 (2^bpc - 1) / 2^bpc + 0.5) <= 65535 (bpc 16: 65535; bpc 8: 65280).
  Out-of-range samples (uint16 value > 2^bpc - 1, worst bpc = 9): |v| <= (65536 \* 65535 + 256) >> 9 = 8,388,480 (~2^23).
- horizontal `h = (sum f_k v_k + 2^15) >> 16`: |h| <= |v|max. In range |h| <= 65535 (reached by a uniform
  max-difference frame: ref 65535 / dis 0). Out-of-range worst |h| <= 8,388,480.
- Frame SAD = sum over N pixels of |h|. In range: 16K 8,697,176,064,000 (2^42.98); 8K 2,319,246,950,400 (2^41.08);
  1080p 135,893,376,000 (2^36.98); cap 70,367,670,435,840 (2^46.0).
  Out-of-range worst (bpc 9): 16K 1.113e15 (2^49.98); cap 9,007,061,815,787,520 (< 2^53 = 9,007,199,254,740,992).
- The SAD accumulator is zeroed before every frame (CUDA `cuda/integer_motion_sad_cuda.c:177`, HIP
  `hip/integer_motion_sad_hip.c:172`), so there is no clip-level (cross-frame) integer accumulator in G3a;
  frames-to-overflow: not applicable.

### Shared headers

| file:line | variable / expression | type (exact C type) | what it sums (per-term max, term count) | worst-case bound at 16K | at cap | verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| integer_motion.h:53 (included by cuda/integer_motion_cuda.h:25; `edge_16` is not called by any G3a twin) | `accum += filter[k] * src[i_tap * stride + j_tap]` | `uint16_t * uint16_t` promotes to `int`; `uint32_t accum`; `int` index | 5 taps, term <= 26386*65535 = 1,729,206,510 (< INT32_MAX, no UB); sum <= 65536*65535 | accum 4,294,901,760; index 132,710,399 (stride ~ W) | accum same (< UINT32_MAX); index 1,073,741,823 (stride ~ W) | SAFE (not used by the twins; recorded for completeness; index stays < 2^31 only while the stride in samples stays < 65536) |

### Aside A: CUDA float_motion tile index can go negative (out-of-bounds read, not an integer overflow)

`cuda/float_motion/float_motion_score.cu:43-50` (`fm_mirror`) reflects once and does not clamp, and
`fm_load_tile` (:83-90) loads a fixed 20x20 tile for every block, padding threads included. The largest tile
index on an axis of extent `sup` is `16 * (ceil(sup / 16) - 1) + 17`; it maps below zero when that exceeds
`2 * (sup - 1)`, i.e. for `sup` in {3..9, 17}. Width or height 3 gives index -13 (13 rows before the
`ref_in` allocation when it is the row axis), 17 gives -1. Those samples feed no valid output (the
consumed taps stay in range from 3x3 up), but the load reads outside the buffer. The HIP twin clamps
(`hip/float_motion/float_motion_score.hip:101-104`, ADR-1381), and the CUDA motion SAD kernel clamps
(`cuda/cuda_tile_index.h`). `core/test/test_cuda_motion_tiny_frames.c:67` covers 3x3 and 17x17 for motion_cuda
and motion_v2_cuda only, not float_motion_cuda. The init guard only refuses below 3x3
(`cuda/float_motion_cuda.c:262`).

### Aside B: CPU reference row accumulator (outside G3a, for the CPU group)

`integer_motion.c:193` and `:243` hold a row's SAD in `uint32_t row_sad`. In range it is <= 32768 \* 65535 =
2,147,450,880 (< 2^32), so it is safe up to the cap. If a 16-bit container carries samples above `2^bpc - 1`
(bpc 9..15; sample range against bpc was not checked in this audit), `abs(h)` reaches 8,388,480 at bpc 9 and
the row sum wraps from W >= 513 (bpc 10: abs(h) <= 4,194,240, W >= 1025). The GPU twins add in 64 bits
and would then differ from the CPU.

## G3b: PSNR (integer + float), moment, CIEDE, tile-index headers (CUDA + HIP)

Repo: master @ 571565a47. Paths are relative to `core/src/feature/`.
Envelope: 16K N = 132,710,400 (2^26.98); cap N = 2^30. Max 16-bit term 65535^2 = 4,294,836,225. Its fp32
square is 4,294,836,224 (the twins' float-square terms). Both values are below 2^32. Row W <= 32768 = 2^15.

out of date. This does not cause an overflow.

## G4a: integer-overflow audit of SSIM (integer and float) and MS-SSIM, CUDA and HIP twins

Repo: master at `571565a47`. This audit was read-only. Every path below is relative to `core/src/feature/`.
Envelope: 16K N = 132,710,400; cap N = 2^30 (W, H <= 32768); 16-bit samples, 4:4:4.

### Derived term maxima (shared by every integer-SSIM row)

- Integer Gaussian `gaussian_filter_init(1.5, 5)` (integer_ssim.c:60-96) has kernel_len = floor(1.5*sqrt(-2 ln(sqrt(pi/2)*1.5/256))) = floor(4.70) = 4, so it has 9 taps `[2,9,28,55,68,55,28,9,2]` with a sum of exactly 256. The CUDA kernel (`ISSIM_KERNEL`, integer_ssim_score.cu:70) and the HIP kernel (integer_ssim_score.hip:84) copy it.
- Horizontal moments (a window of at most 9 taps, at most 65535 per sample):
  - mux and muy: at most 256*65535 = 16,776,960 (2^24).
  - x2, xy and y2: at most 256*65535^2 = 1,099,478,073,600 (< 2^40).
  - w: at most 256.
- Vertical moments (9 taps over the horizontal moments):
  - mux and muy: at most 65536*65535 = 4,294,901,760 (< 2^32).
  - x2, xy and y2: at most 65536*65535^2 = 281,466,386,841,600 (< 2^48).
  - w: at most 65,536 (2^16).
- The bounds above are local to one window and do not depend on the frame size. Frame-level weight sums are Σ m.w ≤ 65536*N: 8,697,308,774,400 (2^42.98) at 16K and 2^46 at the cap.
- The float_ssim decimation is a fixed-point sum in units of 2^-52 over a scale x scale window, with tap = fl(1/scale^2) and sample ≤ 65535/256 = 255.996. A window therefore sums to at most about 256, which is ≤ 255.996*2^52 ≈ 2^59.99998 < 2^60. This bound holds for every scale. The cap of 128 on the scale (SSIM_MAX_EXACT_SCALE / VMAF_HIP_SSIM_MAX_EXACT_SCALE) is there for exactness, not for overflow.
- No accumulator in G4a spans more than one frame (clip level). Every sum is a local in collect() or a per-frame device buffer, so no frames-to-overflow figure applies.

### Asides (verdicts unchanged)

- **Device memory at the cap:** the CUDA and HIP integer SSIM twins allocate 6 int64 moment planes plus 1 double term plane, 7 x 2^33 B = 56 GiB. Every size is computed in `size_t` and passed to `size_t` allocator parameters (cuda/common.h:148, 273; cuda/kernel_template.h:187-188; hip/kernel_template.h:125). At that size the allocation fails cleanly; no size wraps.
- **`warp_reduce(int64_t)` (cuda_helper.cuh:129-130, outside this group):\*\* the helper left-shifts the shuffled signed high half (`<< 32`), which is UB for negative values before C++20. That is unreachable here: the weights are ≥ 0 and below 2^23, so the high half is 0.
- **Grid dimensions:** the largest gridDim.y in the group is ceil(32768/8) = 4096, well under 65535. No grid expression wraps.
- **`picture_copy()` (picture_copy.cpp, outside this group):\*\* the CUDA and HIP MS-SSIM hosts call it. It walks rows with `ptrdiff_t` pointer increments and `unsigned` loop counters, and has no integer product.
- **Tightest margin in the group:** the signed `int` index at cuda/integer_ms_ssim/ms_ssim_score.cu:154 (2^30-1 against INT32_MAX). Next is `peak * peak` in `unsigned` at cuda/integer_ms_ssim_cuda.c:306 and hip/integer_ms_ssim_hip.c:620 (131,070 below UINT32_MAX). Both are safe under the envelope.

## G4b: SSIMULACRA 2, CUDA + HIP twins, ordered-sum header (integer-overflow audit)

Repo: master @ `571565a47`. Read-only; no build, no device run.
All paths below are relative to `core/src/feature/`.

Envelope inputs taken from the code:
- `VMAF_PIC_DIM_MAX 32768u` (`core/src/picture.c:46`, checked at :185), `VMAF_PIC_BPC_MIN/MAX 8u/16u` (`picture.c:37-38`, checked at :181).
- Both twins refuse w or h < 8 (`cuda/ssimulacra2_cuda.c:788`, `hip/ssimulacra2_hip.c:931`). That makes pixels >= 64 and chunks >= 1.
- Chunk = 256 lanes x 4 px = 1024 px (`SS2C_CHUNK_PIXELS`, `SS2H_CHUNK_PIXELS`). A batch is 1024 chunks (`SS2C_BATCH`, `SS2H_BATCH`).
- Scale pyramid: `scale_w[i] = (scale_w[i-1]+1)/2`. The pyramid stops before the first scale with a side below 8. Chunks are counted per plane (one channel); `ceil` applies.

| scale | 16K W x H | N | chunks | cap W x H | N | chunks |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | 15360x8640 | 132,710,400 | 129,600 | 32768x32768 | 2^30 | 2^20 = 1,048,576 |
| 1 | 7680x4320 | 33,177,600 | 32,400 | 16384^2 | 2^28 | 262,144 |
| 2 | 3840x2160 | 8,294,400 | 8,100 | 8192^2 | 2^26 | 65,536 |
| 3 | 1920x1080 | 2,073,600 | 2,025 | 4096^2 | 2^24 | 16,384 |
| 4 | 960x540 | 518,400 | 507 | 2048^2 | 2^22 | 4,096 |
| 5 | 480x270 | 129,600 | 127 | 1024^2 | 2^20 | 1,024 |

Device buffers are sized for scale 0. That scale has the most chunks.

The brief assumed fp64 term planes (6 terms x 3 channels x N x 8 B). These do not exist. Every kernel recomputes the six fp64 terms from the five blurred fp32 planes and the two XYB fp32 planes (`ss2c_terms` / `ss2h_terms`). Per scale, the code stores only three per-(channel, sum, chunk) arrays:
- `chunk_sums`: double, 8 B
- `plan`: int16, 2 B
- `units`: 2 x int64, 16 B

Neither twin has a clip-level (cross-frame) integer accumulator. Each frame's score is appended to the collector on its own, so no row is DEPENDS.

### ordered_sum (shared, `ordered_sum.h`, ADR-1433). Used by the CUDA and HIP twins

The increment of one term in binade e is the term divided by u = 2^(e-52), rounded. In integers this is `mantissa >> (e - ex)`:
- mantissa is in [2^52, 2^53).
- shift = 0 gives an increment of at most 2^53 - 1.
- shift >= 1 gives at most 2^52 after rounding up.
- shift > 53 gives 0.
- A term that does not fit (higher binade, negative, inf or NaN) gives `VMAF_ORDSUM_UNFIT` = 2^54.

Every increment is >= 0 (`round_shifted` returns `whole + {0,1}`).

The composition `vmaf_ordsum_then` saturates at 2^54. The int64 range therefore does not depend on the term count, the chunk size or N. For comparison, an uncapped sum would wrap after 512 UNFIT terms (512 x 2^54 = 2^63). With 1024 terms at the maximum increment it would reach 1024 x (2^53 - 1) = 2^63 - 1024, which still fits.

The cap never changes a result. A capped value (>= 2^54) always fails `total > VMAF_ORDSUM_BINADE_END` in `add_chunk`, and that chunk is then added term by term.

There are no integer accumulators besides the ordered-sum units. The rows below are size products, index and offset math, counters and grid dims.

Input pictures are `cuMemAllocPitch` planes. `pitch` is carried as `size_t` (`ssimulacra2_cuda.h:71`, set at `ssimulacra2_cuda.c:441` from `(size_t)stride`) and multiplied in `size_t` (device.cu:82).

### SSIMULACRA 2: HIP twin (`hip/ssimulacra2_hip.c`, `hip/ssimulacra2_hip.h`, `hip/ssimulacra2/ssimulacra2_device.hip`)

The HIP twin does not read the picture's device pitch. `submit()` packs every plane into pinned staging with `row_bytes = plane_w x bytes_per_sample` (`ss2h_stage_plane`, :895-907) and copies it into a flat `hipMalloc` per plane. The kernel therefore indexes `sy * plane_w + sx` in `size_t`.

### Coverage

All files are under `core/src/feature/`.

- `ordered_sum.h` (full, 344 lines): 10 rows. Covers the binade increments, `round_shifted`, `then` composition and cap, `add_chunk` total, `from_units_bits` exponent and the int16 plan narrowing.
- `cuda/ssimulacra2_cuda.c` (850 lines): 17 rows. Covers host size products, chunk count, grids, readback and the `unsigned pixels` kernel arg.
- `cuda/ssimulacra2_cuda.h` (120 lines): none of its own. It holds the types used by the rows above: `pitch` is `size_t`, `pixels` is `size_t`, `chunks` is `unsigned`, `units` is `int64_t`, `plan` is `int16_t`.
- `cuda/ssimulacra2/ssimulacra2_device.cu` (534 lines): 18 rows.

- `hip/ssimulacra2_hip.c` (1075 lines): 17 rows.
- `hip/ssimulacra2_hip.h` (130 lines): none of its own; it holds the types (`pixels` `size_t`, `chunks` `unsigned`, `units` `int64_t`, `plan` `int16_t`).
- `hip/ssimulacra2/ssimulacra2_device.hip` (780 lines): 17 rows.
- `ssimulacra2_math.h` (115 lines): 2 rows (cube-root seed, EOTF LUT index).
- `ssimulacra2_eotf_lut.h` (1061 lines; integer parts only): none.
- `ssimulacra2_score.h` (55 lines): none.
- `ssimulacra2_pixel_format.h` (51 lines): none.
- Cross-checked, not in the group: `core/src/picture.c:37-38, :46, :181-185` (bpc 8-16, dims <= 32768); `core/src/cuda/common.h:148, :273` (`vmaf_cuda_buffer_alloc` and `vmaf_cuda_buffer_host_alloc` take `size_t`).

Verdict totals: 88 rows (shared ordered_sum 10, CUDA 42, HIP 34, math.h 2). SAFE 88, OVERFLOW@16K 0, OVERFLOW@CAP-ONLY 0, DEPENDS 0. Five more entries are listed as "none" (lut decl, score.h, pixel_format.h, and the two struct headers).

Tightest margin in the group: CUDA `ssimulacra2_xyb`, which indexes with the 32-bit `unsigned` `2u * pixels + i` (device.cu:315, :349). At cap the index reaches 3,221,225,471, which is below 2^32 = 4,294,967,296 (headroom 2^0.42). It is safe only because N <= 2^30 and the type is unsigned: as `int` it would overflow at cap, and with a fourth plane it would wrap. The HIP twin uses `size_t` for the same index.

## G5: CAMBI and PSNR-HVS, CUDA and HIP twins: integer-overflow audit

Repo: master at 571565a47. Read-only; nothing built or run on a device.
Paths are relative to `core/src/feature/`.

Envelope: 16K = 15360x8640, N = 132,710,400 (2^26.98). Cap = W,H <= 32768, N <= 2^30.

### CAMBI

#### Bounds that apply to every CAMBI row

- **Window guard.** `vmaf_cambi_check_window_fits_lut()` (cambi.c:1833) runs in the CUDA init (integer_cambi_cuda.c:400) and the HIP init (integer_cambi_hip.c:393). It rejects any window w with w^2 >= 4226, for both the encode window and the source window. So w <= 65, pad <= 32, and no window holds more than 65*65 = 4225 pixels, at any resolution.
- **What the guard means for resolution.** At window_size >= 15 (the option minimum), the guard rejects W+H >= 26,400, or W+H >= 52,400 with the high-res speed-up. So W=H=32768 never runs CAMBI.
  - Largest reachable per-scale n is about 1.742e8 (2^27.38).
  - Largest reachable preprocess/mask plane is about 6.86e8 (2^29.35), with the speed-up.
  - 16K runs only with window_size 15 or 16, or window_size <= 32 with the speed-up.
  - The "cap" column still uses n = 2^30, the conservative value. No verdict changes because of this.
- **Levels.** levels = v_band_size <= tvi_max + 1 <= 1023 + 32 + 1 = 1056 (cambi.c:1951-1965). Preprocessed samples are <= 1024: for 16 bpc, (65535 + 32) >> 6 = 1024.
- **c-value maximum.** c = w \* p0 \* pm / (p0 + pm). Weight w <= 9 (g_contrast_weights, cambi.c:97). p0 and pm count pixels of two different levels in one window, so p0 + pm <= 4225. That gives c <= 9 \* 2112 \* 2113 / 4225 = 9506.25 (2^13.22). The fixed point is c \* 2^24 < 2^37.22. Call this F.
- **No clip-level accumulators.** Every integer sum is reset each frame (memset of the select/results/frame state), and the score leaves as a per-frame double. Frames-to-overflow does not apply.

- **DCT intermediates.** od_bin_fdct8 is applied to columns, then to rows. It is bounded with affine arithmetic over the 64 samples in [0, M]: the exact linear part, plus +/-0.5 for every rounding shift.
  - **12-bit:**
    - max |intermediate| = 32,795
    - max |t*K + r| = 379,769,216 (2^28.50; row pass, K = 11585)
    - max |AC coefficient| = 16,414, so AC^2 = 2.69e8 (2^28.0)
    - max |coefficient| = 32,795
  - **16-bit (rejected input), for reference:** max |t*K + r| = 6.07e9 (2^32.5) and AC^2 = 6.87e10 (2^36), so both would overflow int32. The products first exceed 2^31 at 15-bit samples, which leaves 2.5 bits of margin above the guard.
- **Block counts.** Step 7, 8x8 blocks, so blocks per plane = ((W-8)/7+1) \* ((H-8)/7+1).
  - 16K: 2,707,396 per plane; 4:4:4 total over 3 planes 8,122,188.
  - Cap: 21,911,761 per plane; 4:4:4 total 65,735,283 (2^25.97).
- **No clip-level accumulators.** Per-frame float sums are converted to double scores.

## G6 SpEED (speed_chroma, speed_temporal): CUDA + HIP integer-overflow audit

Repo: master at 571565a47. Read only. Paths are relative to `core/src/feature/`.

### Geometry derivation (applies to every row)

SpEED does not run on the full plane. `speed_internal_init_dimensions()` (`speed_internal.c:65-96`) computes the operating geometry, and `si_gpu_fill_geometry()` (`speed_internal.c:833-858`) narrows it to `uint32_t` in `SpeedGpuGeometry`:

- `scaled = lround(src * speed_prescale)`. The option `speed_prescale` is in [0.1, 4.0] on all four extractors (`cuda/speed_chroma_cuda.c:87-88`, `cuda/speed_temporal_cuda.c:88-89`, `hip/speed_chroma_hip.c:89-90`, `hip/speed_temporal_hip.c:92-93`). \*\*The scaled plane can therefore be up to 16x the picture plane.\*\*
- `down = scaled >> 4`, `trunc = down / 5 * 5`, `blocks = (trunc_w/5)*(trunc_h/5)`, `sub = trunc - 4`.
- chroma 4:4:4 uses the luma size (`speed_chroma_dimensions()`, `speed_internal.h:100`). The temporal extractor uses luma.

Every bound below was derived at two prescales: p=1 (default) and p=4 (option max, the worst case). Values come from the formulas above, computed in python.

| point | scaled WxH | down | trunc | blocks | sub_w*sub_h |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 16K p=1 | 15360x8640 | 960x540 | 960x540 | 20,736 | 956*536 = 512,416 |
| 16K p=4 | 61440x34560 | 3840x2160 | 3840x2160 | 331,776 | 3836*2156 = 8,270,416 |
| cap p=1 | 32768x32768 | 2048x2048 | 2045x2045 | 167,281 | 2041^2 = 4,165,681 |
| cap p=4 | 131072x131072 | 8192x8192 | 8190x8190 | 2,683,044 | 8186^2 = 67,010,596 |
| 32740^2 p=4 (inside cap) | 130960^2 | 8185^2 | 8185^2 | 2,679,769 | 8181^2 = 66,928,761 (odd) |

Channels: chroma 4, temporal 2. Raw plane bytes: 16K, 16-bit: 265,420,800; at the cap, 32768^2*2 = 2^31.

There are no integer pixel accumulators in SpEED. Every sum over pixels (means, covariance, filters, solve, variance) is fp32 or an fp32 pair. There are no atomics, `__shfl`, warp/wave integer reductions or histograms in any G6 file. The integer surface is sizes, indices, grid dims, the uint32 tail layout, int-to-float conversions of counts, float-to-int coordinate conversions and the uint64 singular tally.

### Asides (not verdict rows)

- Device memory, not an integer issue. The `speed_prescale` maximum of 4 makes the SCALED buffer 4 ch \* 16 \* N \* 4 B. That is about 34 GB at 16K and 256 GiB at the cap. The allocation fails cleanly (`vmaf_cuda_buffer_alloc` / `hipMalloc` return an errno). All size math is `size_t`.
- The same covariance divisor form exists outside G6 in `sycl/speed_sycl_pipeline.cpp:808` (`static_cast<float>(a.sub_w * a.sub_h)`). Not audited here; it most likely shares the OVERFLOW@CAP-ONLY parity issue.
- The CPU `compute_mean` (speed.c:775) also rounds its count to float. The means rows are therefore SAFE for parity even above 2^24. Only the covariance divisor differs from the CPU.
