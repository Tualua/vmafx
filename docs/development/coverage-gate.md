# Coverage Gate

The Coverage Gate fails a pull request when line coverage of the CPU build falls below a floor. Two required checks run it: `Coverage Gate` (hosted CPU build) and `Coverage GPU` (self-hosted GPU build). Both are defined in [`.github/workflows/tests-and-quality-gates.yml`](../../.github/workflows/tests-and-quality-gates.yml) and listed in the `Required Checks Aggregator` ([ADR-1297](../adr/1297-ci-gate-every-reporting-check.md)). The floors come from [`docs/principles.md`](../principles.md) §3; the ratchet rules are [ADR-0922](../adr/0922-coverage-ratchet-aggressive.md).

## When you need this page

A PR shows `Coverage Gate` or `Coverage GPU` red, or you want to raise or lower a floor. To reproduce a failure, run the commands in [Debugging a failing gate](#debugging-a-failing-gate).

## What the gate checks

[`scripts/ci/coverage-check.sh`](../../scripts/ci/coverage-check.sh) takes a gcovr JSON summary and two percentages:

```text
scripts/ci/coverage-check.sh <gcovr-summary.json> <overall_min%> <critical_min%>
```

1. Overall line coverage, the unweighted average over every file in the summary, must reach the overall minimum. Exit code 1 on failure.
2. Every security-critical file must reach the critical minimum, unless it has an entry in the `PER_FILE_MIN` map of the script. Security-critical files match `*core/src/dnn/*`, `*core/src/opt.cpp` and `*core/src/read_json_model.cpp`. A critical file with no executed lines is listed but not enforced.

The script defaults are 70 % overall and 90 % critical. The workflow passes its own values:

| Job | Invocation in the workflow | Overall | Critical |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `Coverage Gate` (`coverage`) | `coverage-check.sh core/build-coverage/coverage.json 37 85` | 37 % | 85 % |
| `Coverage GPU` (`coverage-gpu`) | `coverage-check.sh core/build-coverage-gpu/coverage.json 70 85` | 70 % | 85 % |

The CPU job's 37 % overall floor tracks the measured value after the 2026-05-19 merge burst of new scaffold code, as the comment above the step records (ADR-0637). The per-file values in `PER_FILE_MIN` apply in both jobs.

The `coverage` job skips itself in-job when `scripts/ci/plan-ci-impact.py` ([ADR-1140](../adr/1140-ci-impact-planner.md)) reports no impacted source, so the check always reports and `skipped` is never its outcome.

### Per-file overrides

Some files have a structural ceiling below the critical floor. They live in the `PER_FILE_MIN` map of `coverage-check.sh`, and each entry cites the ADR that justifies it.

| File | Floor | Justification |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `core/src/dnn/ort_backend.c` | 83 % | [ADR-0114](../adr/0114-coverage-gate-per-file-overrides.md): the CUDA execution-provider success arm is unreachable on a CPU-only ONNX Runtime. |
| `core/src/dnn/dnn_api.c` | 83 % | ADR-0114: same ceiling as `ort_backend.c`. |
| `core/src/dnn/tiny_extractor_template.h` | 75 % | [ADR-0881](../adr/0881-coverage-overrides-audit-2026-05-30.md): template helpers are only instantiated by callers. |

Overrides only ratchet upward.

### The per-PR delta script

[`scripts/ci/coverage-delta-check.sh`](../../scripts/ci/coverage-delta-check.sh) compares a base and a head gcovr summary and fails when overall coverage, or a touched file's coverage, drops by more than a tolerance (0.5 percentage points by default). Exit code 1 means the overall drop, 2 a per-file drop, 3 a usage error. ADR-0922 introduced it, but no step of `tests-and-quality-gates.yml` calls it today, so it is a local tool, not a required check. Run it by hand:

```bash
scripts/ci/coverage-delta-check.sh \
  --base-json /path/to/base-coverage.json \
  --head-json core/build-coverage/coverage.json \
  --changed-files "$(git diff --name-only origin/master...HEAD)"
```

The options are `--base-json`, `--head-json`, `--changed-files`, `--max-overall-drop` and `--max-file-drop`; read the header of the script for the exact input format.

## Debugging a failing gate

The `coverage-cpu` and `coverage-gpu` artifacts of the failed run hold `coverage.json`, `coverage.txt` and `coverage.xml`. `coverage.txt` lists per-file numbers. To check a downloaded summary:

```bash
scripts/ci/coverage-check.sh coverage.json 37 85
```

To rebuild what the `Coverage Gate` job builds (needs `gcovr`):

```bash
cd core
meson setup build-coverage --buildtype=debug \
  -Db_coverage=true -Denable_cuda=false -Denable_sycl=false \
  -Denable_float=true -Denable_avx512=true -Denable_dnn=enabled \
  -Dc_args=-fprofile-update=atomic -Dcpp_args=-fprofile-update=atomic
ninja -C build-coverage
python3 ../scripts/ci/run_meson_test.py -- -C build-coverage --print-errorlogs --num-processes 1
gcovr --root .. \
    --filter 'src/.*' \
    --exclude '.*/test/.*' --exclude '.*/tests/.*' --exclude '.*/subprojects/.*' \
    --gcov-ignore-parse-errors=negative_hits.warn \
    --gcov-ignore-parse-errors=suspicious_hits.warn \
    --json-summary build-coverage/coverage.json \
    --txt build-coverage/coverage.txt \
    build-coverage
../scripts/ci/coverage-check.sh build-coverage/coverage.json 37 85
```

`-fprofile-update=atomic` and `--num-processes 1` are both needed so test binaries do not corrupt each other's counters in the shared `libvmaf.so` ([ADR-0110](../adr/0110-coverage-gate-fprofile-update-atomic.md)). The CI job also runs a Python suite before collecting coverage; a local run without it measures lower on the DNN files.

`make coverage-check` runs the same recipe locally: it builds the instrumented tree in `build-coverage/`, runs the meson suite serially, writes the gcovr summary `build-coverage/coverage.json` and passes it to `coverage-check.sh` with the local floors `COVERAGE_MIN_OVERALL` (37) and `COVERAGE_MIN_CRITICAL` (85) from the Makefile. `make coverage-html` renders the gcovr HTML report. `coverage-check.sh` exits 2 on an input that is not a gcovr JSON summary, an lcov `.info` file included. Like the CI job without its Python suite, a local run measures the DNN files lower.

## Raising a floor

Raising needs no ADR. Change the numbers in the `Enforce coverage thresholds` step of the workflow (or the value in `PER_FILE_MIN`), confirm that the latest master run is above the new floor, and leave a comment with the date and the measurement.

## Lowering a floor

Lowering any floor needs a new ADR that supersedes ADR-0922 (and ADR-0114 for a per-file override):

1. Allocate it with `scripts/adr/next-free.sh --claim <slug>`. State why the lower floor is unavoidable and what mitigates the loss of coverage.
2. Cite the ADR inline at the changed number, for example `# ADR-NNNN — supersedes ADR-0922, lowers floor to X%`. A bare number change is rejected in review.
3. Use `PER_FILE_MIN` for a per-file exception. No other suppression mechanism exists.
