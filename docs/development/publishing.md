# Artifact publishing policy (Phase 4b.9)

All canonical build artifacts for the VMAFx fork are produced inside an
image built from `dev/Containerfile`: the `vmaf-dev-mcp` container locally, or
one of its stages in CI (`release-build` for the native release bundle). Host-side
meson/ninja builds are available
for diagnostic purposes (IDE integration, debugger sessions, sanitizer sweeps)
but are **not** the authoritative source for any published artifact.

The policy is recorded in
[ADR-1102](../adr/1102-phase4b9-container-only-publishing.md).

---

## What "canonical artifact" means

A canonical artifact is any file that is:

- Tagged in a GitHub release (`libvmaf.so`, Python wheels, CLI binaries).
- Published to a container registry (`ghcr.io/vmafx/vmafx:*`).
- Attached to a CI run as a downloadable artifact and used downstream
  (benchmark result JSON, snapshot score files).

Intermediate build objects (`*.o`, `*.a`, build directories) and developer
tooling outputs (flamegraphs, profile data, local benchmark runs) are
**not** canonical artifacts and are not covered by this policy.

---

## Container-first rule

Before building an artifact for publication, verify that the container image
is up to date with `master`:

```bash
# Check image age vs. last master commit that touched a relevant path
git log --oneline -1 -- core/ mcp-server/ ai/ tools/vmaf-tune/ dev/

# Rebuild if the image predates that commit
docker compose --project-directory "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)" \
  -f dev/docker-compose.yml build dev-mcp
docker compose -f dev/docker-compose.yml up -d
```

Then run the artifact build inside the container:

```bash
docker exec vmaf-dev-mcp bash -c "
  cd /workspace && \
  meson setup build -Denable_cuda=true -Denable_sycl=true && \
  ninja -C build
"
```

The resulting binaries at `/workspace/build/` and `/usr/local/bin/vmaf`
inside the container are the ones this policy calls canonical. Stamp the
staged tree before it leaves the container so its provenance travels with it
(see [Enforcement](#enforcement)):

```bash
docker exec vmaf-dev-mcp \
  bash /workspace/scripts/ci/check-container-build.sh --stamp /workspace/artifacts
```

---

## Rebuild trigger conditions

Rebuild the container image (not just `ninja`) when any of the following
change on `master`:

| Trigger | Why |
|---------|-----|
| `dev/Containerfile` or `dev/docker-compose.yml` | Base image or layer set changed |
| `core/` (any C source, header, or meson file) | Library ABI or build output changed |
| `mcp-server/vmaf-mcp/` | MCP server entry point or dependencies changed |
| `ai/` | ONNX Runtime integration or model interface changed |
| `tools/vmaf-tune/` | vmaf-tune CLI changed |
| `ffmpeg-patches/` | Downstream FFmpeg integration changed |
| Python dependency files (`requirements*.txt`, `pyproject.toml`) | Runtime environment changed |

A single `git log --oneline -1 -- <paths>` against the above list
is sufficient to decide. If the most recent commit touching any of those
paths post-dates the container image's build timestamp, rebuild.

---

## Host-side builds: when they are appropriate

| Use case | Appropriate? |
|----------|-------------|
| Running clang-tidy / clangd (IDE integration) | Yes — use `build/` configured with CPU backend |
| gdb / lldb crash investigation | Yes — use the sanitizer-enabled host build |
| ASan / UBSan / TSan sweep | Yes — `meson setup build-asan -Db_sanitize=address` |
| Producing a release binary | **No** — must use container |
| Running the Netflix golden gate | Yes — it is a verification job, not an artifact producer, and is out of scope for this policy. The CI job `netflix-golden` in `tests-and-quality-gates.yml` builds with host meson/ninja on `ubuntu-latest` and runs pytest there |
| Quick local smoke test during development | Yes — acceptable, but results should not be published |

If a backend fails to reproduce in the container, diagnose the container first.
Fix `dev/Containerfile` rather than chasing host toolchain drift. The host's
toolchain versions (system icpx, system CUDA, host Python) are intentionally
not pinned and will diverge over time.

---

## CI integration

There is no `release.yml` and no `cross-backend.yml`. The publishing pipeline
is four workflows:

| Workflow / job | Trigger | Produces | Builds in a container? |
|---|---|---|---|
| `.github/workflows/dev-container-publish.yml` | push to `master` (`dev/Containerfile`, `dev/scripts/**`) | `ghcr.io/vmafx/vmafx-dev-mcp:sha-<commit>`, `:master` | Yes — builds `libvmaf-build` stage. Published for transparency; releases do not pull it |
| `.github/workflows/release-please.yml` | push to `master` | the release PR and, on merge, the tag + GitHub release | n/a — no build |
| `.github/workflows/supply-chain.yml` | `release: published` | `libvmaf.so` chain, the `vmaf` CLI, `models.tar.gz`, SBOMs, cosign signatures, GitHub build-provenance attestations, the `vmaf-mcp` wheel | **Yes** — `build-artifacts` builds the Debian 13 `release-build` stage of the release tag's `dev/Containerfile` on a GitHub-hosted runner and compiles inside it ([ADR-1346](../adr/1346-hosted-slim-container-release-build.md), [ADR-1354](../adr/1354-native-bundle-release-track.md)) |
| `.github/workflows/docker-publish-production.yml` | `release: published` | `ghcr.io/vmafx/vmafx:*` (cpu / cuda13 / rocm10 / oneapi2026, also tagged oneapi2025 / server) | Yes, inherently — `docker buildx` against `docker/Dockerfile.production*` |

Consequences:

- Release native binaries (`libvmaf.so` SONAME chain, `vmaf` CLI, `models.tar.gz`)
  are compiled inside the `release-build` stage, built in the release job from
  the tagged commit's own `dev/Containerfile` on the Debian 13 release-track
  base. The only registry pulls are the digest-pinned base image and BuildKit
  frontend it names; no external layer cache is involved
  ([ADR-1346](../adr/1346-hosted-slim-container-release-build.md), which
  supersedes ADR-1178, as amended by
  [ADR-1354](../adr/1354-native-bundle-release-track.md)).
- Non-release PR CI gates (e.g. `tests-and-quality-gates.yml`) continue to run on
  host runners for fast unit testing. When a container run and a CI host run
  disagree, the toolchain difference remains a live hypothesis.

Note that `docker/Dockerfile.production` and `docker/Dockerfile.production-gpu`
are *not* `dev/Containerfile`. The published images are built from their own
Dockerfiles; `dev/Containerfile` is the development and artifact-build
container.

See [docs/development/ci.md](ci.md) for the full CI gate list and
[docs/development/dev-mcp.md](dev-mcp.md) for the container operator guide.

## Compression

Every archive and image the project publishes is written at the strongest compression
that all of its documented consumers open, deterministically
([ADR-1591](../adr/1591-package-compression.md), [ADR-1594](../adr/1594-zstd-images-zopfli-zips.md);
consumer versions and measurements in
[Research-2142](../research/2142-package-compression-consumers.md)). Nothing it holds
changes: the same files, the same licence check and SBOM, other bytes on the wire.

| Artifact | Producer | Compression | Size at the rc.2 inputs | Limit |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | ---: | :--- |
| macOS tester bundle `.tar.xz` | `scripts/ci/build-macos-tester-bundle.sh` | tar + xz level 9 (libarchive, one thread) | 26.6 MB (gzip 6: 69.8 MB) | macOS 14 `tar` and Archive Utility read xz; Apple's libarchive has no zstd |
| Windows tester zips (x64, arm64, x64 CUDA) | `scripts/ci/build-windows-tester-bundle.py` | Deflate by zopfli 0.4.3 (15 iterations, hash-locked in `requirements/locks/windows-tester-zip.txt`), every entry | 43.9 / 38.7 / 329.4 MB (zlib 9: 45.6 / 40.1 / 343.8 MB; zlib 6: 46.6 / 41.0 / 351.4 MB) | Windows 10 `tar`, Explorer and `Expand-Archive` read Stored and Deflate only |
| `models.tar.gz`, `licenses.tar.gz` (release) | `scripts/release/build-native-release-artifacts.sh` | `gzip -9n` | 42.20 MB (gzip 6: 42.25 MB) | xz-utils and zstd are not Essential on Debian; xz would save another 2 % |
| git-archive source tarballs (`licensing.py fetch-sources`, the FFmpeg source in `docker/Dockerfile.node`) | as named | `git archive --format=tar.gz -9` | 1.5 % smaller than level 6 on this repository's `core/` and `scripts/` | name and format kept for the source indexes |
| Container images and their `-source` images (tester, production, operator, server, node, the rc licence companions) | `docker-publish-tester.yml`, `docker-publish-production.yml`, `docker-publish-operator-node.yml`, `published-rc-licence-companions.yml`, `.github/actions/image-licence-artifacts` | zstd, BuildKit's best level (22), `force-compression`, OCI media types, on every layer (`IMAGE_COMPRESSION`) | tester 267.8 to 200.1 MB, oneAPI 1,424 to 1,073 MB, ROCm 10 8,310 to 7,065 MB, CPU CLI 55.7 to 51.5 MB (amd64) | pulling needs Docker Engine 23.0, Docker Desktop 4.19, containerd 1.5 or Podman ([requirements](../usage/docker.md#what-can-pull-the-images)) |
| `ghcr.io/vmafx/vmafx-dev-mcp` | `dev-container-publish.yml` | the same `IMAGE_COMPRESSION` | 17.0 to 14.0 GB | encoding adds an estimated 2 to 4 minutes to a job that used 57 of its 90 |

Three mechanics keep the table true:

- With `compression=zstd`, BuildKit converts every layer that is not zstd yet, but only
  under `force-compression`: base-image layers and the layers imported from the GitHub
  Actions cache (which always stores gzip) arrive as gzip and would otherwise be pushed
  as they are. The converted base layers no longer carry their upstream digests, so a
  host that has the base image downloads them again. `oci-mediatypes=true` is required:
  under Docker media types BuildKit labels zstd layers in a way Docker cannot pull.
- The `push:` shorthand of `docker/build-push-action` carries no compression; every push
  uses `outputs:` ending in `IMAGE_COMPRESSION`. The tester's local `load:` step is not
  published.
- `scripts/ci/tests/test_package_compression.py` fails when a publishing workflow loses
  `IMAGE_COMPRESSION` or changes it, when another workflow starts pushing an image, when
  the macOS or source archives change their compression, or when the zopfli pins
  disagree. The Windows zip (zopfli streams, and records equal to `zipfile`'s), the
  report bundle and the release tarballs have behavioural tests next to their builders.

## Enforcement

The policy is checked by `scripts/ci/check-container-build.sh`. Without it the
policy was documentation only: nothing anywhere could tell a container build
from a host build, so a host-built binary could be attached to a release with
no signal at all.

`dev/Containerfile` writes a marker at `/etc/vmafx-dev-container` in its first
(`build-deps`) stage, so every downstream stage inherits it, and writes the
same bytes in `release-build`, the separate Debian 13 root the native release
compiles in. The unit suite fails if the two writes differ. The marker is the
gate's single source of truth:

```text
vmafx_dev_container=1
image_title=vmaf-dev-mcp
containerfile=dev/Containerfile
source=https://github.com/VMAFx/vmafx
```

The gate has three modes, and fails closed in all three — a missing marker, a
foreign container's marker, a truncated marker, a missing stamp, an empty
stamp, or a stamp of an unknown schema all exit non-zero:

```bash
# 1. Am I in the container? Exit 0 only inside vmaf-dev-mcp.
scripts/ci/check-container-build.sh

# 2. Record provenance into a staged artifact tree. Asserts (1) first, so a
#    host build cannot produce the stamp.
scripts/ci/check-container-build.sh --stamp artifacts

# 3. Verify a stamped tree. Runs anywhere — the verifying job does not itself
#    need to be containerised.
scripts/ci/check-container-build.sh --verify artifacts
```

Mode 2 writes `artifacts/container-build-provenance.txt`:

```text
schema=vmafx-container-build-provenance/1
vmafx_dev_container=1
image_title=vmaf-dev-mcp
containerfile=dev/Containerfile
source=https://github.com/VMAFx/vmafx
git_commit=<GITHUB_SHA or git rev-parse HEAD>
stamped_at=<SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH or now, UTC>
```

This is an **accident gate, not a security boundary**. It catches "the release
job silently ran meson on the runner host", which is the failure this policy
exists to prevent. It does not defend against someone who deliberately forges
the marker; the cryptographic story for published bytes is cosign signing plus
GitHub build-provenance attestations in `supply-chain.yml`.

**Known limitation:** the `VMAFX_CONTAINER_MARKER` environment variable
overrides the marker path (introduced so the offline unit suite
`scripts/ci/tests/test-check-container-build.sh` can test container and host
behaviours without modifying `/etc`). A CI job or runner setting this variable
to point to a valid marker file will bypass the gate. This is consistent with
the accident-gate threat model: the gate prevents inadvertent host builds in
the release pipeline, not malicious evasion.

### Where the gate runs today

| Job / Script | What it asserts |
|---|---|
| `Dev Container Build` in `dev-container-build.yml` | the gate rejects the bare runner, accepts the built image, and a stamp made inside the image verifies outside it; the release rehearsal then runs the whole release build in `release-build` and verifies its stamp |
| `Release Script Contract (ADR-1128)` in `rule-enforcement.yml` | the gate's hermetic unit suite (`scripts/ci/tests/test-check-container-build.sh`, no Docker needed), including that `build-deps` and `release-build` write identical markers and that `release-build` roots at `RELEASE_BUILDER_BASE` |
| `build-artifacts` in `supply-chain.yml` | runs `--assert`, then stamps `artifacts/` with `--stamp`, both inside the `release-build` stage it builds from the release tag (ADR-1346, ADR-1354) |
| `verify-native-artifacts` in `supply-chain.yml` | verifies downloaded `artifacts/` with `scripts/ci/check-container-build.sh --verify`, which rejects a missing, empty, malformed or symlinked stamp; then runs the bundle on `ubuntu-24.04` and on the release runtime image |
| `scripts/release/verify-native-release-artifacts.sh` | verifies staged release bundle contains valid, non-empty, non-symlink `container-build-provenance.txt` |
| `attach-to-release` in `supply-chain.yml` | requires `container-build-provenance.txt` as a required release asset and verifies cosign signature bundle |

### Release compilation environment (ADR-1346)

[ADR-1346](../adr/1346-hosted-slim-container-release-build.md) moved native
release compilation off the self-hosted Arc runner that ADR-1178 required. No
such runner was registered, so a published release would have waited 24 hours
and been cancelled.
[ADR-1354](../adr/1354-native-bundle-release-track.md) then moved the compile
from the Ubuntu 26.04 `build-deps` stage onto the Debian 13 release track.
`build-artifacts` in `.github/workflows/supply-chain.yml` runs on
`ubuntu-latest`:

1. It checks out the release tag.
2. It builds the `release-build` stage of that tag's `dev/Containerfile` with
   `scripts/ci/build-dev-container-stage.sh release-build`. `release-build` is
   the digest-pinned Debian 13 base `RELEASE_BUILDER_BASE` from
   `build-config.env` plus Debian archive packages (GCC 14, Meson, Ninja, NASM,
   `xxd`, a pinned `patchelf`) and downloads nothing from third parties, so the
   job needs no GitHub token. The build uses the default Docker builder with no
   external layer cache and no registry, so no state from another workflow run
   can enter a release. An uncached build of the stage took under a minute on
   a workstation; the job allows 60.
3. It runs `scripts/release/build-native-release-artifacts.sh` in that image
   with `docker run --pull never --network none`, as the runner's user, with
   the checkout mounted. The script asserts the container marker, refuses to
   build unless the checkout is `GITHUB_SHA` (the commit the stamp records),
   builds `libvmaf` and the CLI with Meson (the unit tests are left out; see
   below), stages the bundle with the CLI's RUNPATH set to `$ORIGIN`, writes
   `container-build-provenance.txt` and runs the clean-environment verifier.
   The compile took under a minute on four CPUs.
4. It hashes and uploads `artifacts/` on the runner for SBOM, signing, build
   provenance and attachment, exactly as before.

The stamp records `image_title=vmaf-dev-mcp`. `build-deps` writes that marker
and every later stage of `dev/Containerfile` inherits it; `release-build`
writes the same bytes. The gate accepts no other identity.
`verify-native-artifacts` then checks the stamp, runs the downloaded bundle on
`ubuntu-24.04` (glibc 2.39, the oldest GitHub-hosted image that can load it)
and starts the CLI on the release runtime image `RELEASE_RUNTIME_CC`
(distroless `cc-debian13`), each time with no `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`, so the
CLI must find `libvmaf.so.3` through its RUNPATH `$ORIGIN`. See
[the release guide](release.md#native-linux-release-layout) for the runtime
requirements.

**Why the unit tests are not compiled.** Debian 13's GCC 14.2 crashed at
random with an internal compiler error while link-time optimising the unit-test
executables: two of three full builds on a workstation failed, once with
`corrupted size vs. prev_size` inside `lto1`. The release ships only
`libvmaf.so*` and `vmaf`, other CI jobs build and run the tests, and the
`docker/` release images already configure `-Denable_tests=false` on the same
base.

**What is pinned and what is not.** The base image is pinned by digest through
`build-config.env`, and `patchelf` is pinned to Debian 13's package version
(`PATCHELF_VERSION`) because it rewrites the published CLI's RUNPATH. The
other Debian archive packages in `release-build` resolve when the stage is
built, so rebuilding an old tag later may install a newer compiler or Meson
from a Debian point release than the original release used. The release
compile itself runs with networking disabled.

**Release track.** `build-config.env` says published artifacts are built on
the `RELEASE_*` track (`RELEASE_BUILDER_BASE`, Debian 13, glibc 2.41) and ship
on `RELEASE_RUNTIME_CC` (distroless `cc-debian13`). The native bundle follows
that rule. Until ADR-1354 it was built on the `DEV_*` track and needed glibc
2.43, which ADR-1346 recorded as an exception for 1.0.0-rc.1.

**Rehearsal on every container-affecting pull request.** The Dev Container PR
gate (`dev-container-build.yml`) builds `release-build` with the same script
and runs the same `docker run` invocation. A pull request checkout reaches no tag,
so the gate first creates a local lightweight tag named after
`.release-please-manifest.json`'s version on `HEAD`; `vmaf --version` then
reports the `v<version>-0-g<commit>` form a release reports, and the verifier
checks it against the manifest version.

To reproduce the release build locally from a clean checkout of the tag (use a
UID that owns the checkout; the image needs no passwd entry for it):

```bash
tag=vX.Y.Z
bash scripts/ci/build-dev-container-stage.sh release-build vmafx-release-build:local
docker run --rm --pull never --network none --user "$(id -u):$(id -g)" \
  --volume "$PWD:/src" --workdir /src vmafx-release-build:local \
  bash scripts/release/build-native-release-artifacts.sh "${tag#v}"
bash scripts/ci/check-container-build.sh --verify artifacts
```

`.github/workflows/dev-container-publish.yml` still publishes
`ghcr.io/vmafx/vmafx-dev-mcp` (the `libvmaf-build` stage) for transparency and
contributor convenience. No release job pulls it.

Run the unit suite locally with:

```bash
bash scripts/ci/tests/test-check-container-build.sh
```

## Exceptions

- **Tester image** (`ghcr.io/vmafx/vmafx:<tag>-tester`): built from its own Dockerfile
  (`docker/Dockerfile.tester`), like the production images, by
  `docker-publish-tester.yml` ([ADR-1492](../adr/1492-tester-image-arm64-report.md)).
- **macOS tester bundle**: macOS cannot be built in the Linux container, so the bundle is
  built on the hosted macOS arm64 runner from a published tag, attested and signed,
  and published only as a `tester-*` prerelease asset, never as a release binary
  ([ADR-1493](../adr/1493-macos-tester-bundle.md)). See
  [the maintainer notes](tester-image.md).
