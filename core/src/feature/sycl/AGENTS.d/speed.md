# SpEED pipeline arithmetic and singular covariance

- **SpEED pipeline arithmetic contract ([ADR-1358](../../../../../docs/adr/1358-sycl-speed-device-resident-linalg.md)).**
  Every SpEED kernel lives in `speed_sycl_pipeline.cpp`; two
  extractor TUs and `speed_sycl_host.cpp` hold none and never wait on
  queue outside `pipeline_collect()` / `pipeline_wait()`. four
  TUs are built with contraction off like every feature TU
  (`sycl_strict_fp_args`, ADR-1367). In
  pipeline, every division and square root goes through `div_rn()` /
  `sqrt_rn()` (shared with ssimulacra2 in `sycl_exact_fp.h`, ADR-1363),
  every product feeding add sits in named
  temporary, and fp64 comparisons of `speed.c` go through
  `below_eps()` / `below_eps_scaled()`. file must not mention
  fp64 type at all (`core/test/test_sycl_kernel_source_contract.py`).
  Entropy + score = host tail (ADR-1477): device chain ends at
  `launch_solve()` (variances); `enqueue_frame()` copies tail block
  (`SpeedGpuTailLayout`: status, eigenvalues, variances; one USM
  allocation) and `pipeline_collect()` waits, then calls
  `speed_internal_gpu_tail_scores()` (`speed_internal.c`) = `speed.c`'s own
  fp64 `log2()` statements on host's libm. No kernel evaluates
  logarithm; twin == CPU bit for bit on any libm (icx or GCC build). Gate
  cells `speed_chroma.sycl`, `speed_temporal.sycl`
  (`scripts/ci/exact_twins.d/`); parity tests assert `==`.
  Givens rotation = `speed_givens_unit()` (`feature/speed_givens.h`, shared
  with CUDA + HIP): upstream's `1.0 / sqrt(1 + t * t)` in fp32 from
  `sqrt_rn` / `div_rn` / `sycl::fma`; proven on every input by
  `test_speed_upstream_form`. Not `div_rn(1.0f, sqrt_rn(u))`.
  `lanczos4` prescale weights = host table, never device sine: CPU
  rounds each weight once from fp64 `sin()`, `sycl::sinpi()` is ulps off
  and SpEED amplifies (5.8e-5 relative on A380,
  `T-GPU-SPEED-LANCZOS4-PRESCALE-DRIFT-2026-09-30`). `upload_lanczos()`
  fills `Pipeline::lanczos` (device USM) at init from
  `speed_internal_gpu_lanczos_weights()`; `scale_lanczos()` reads `wx` /
  `wy` from it, so no private `wx[9]` / `wy[9]` (scratch, ADR-1395).
  Contract test plants `sycl::sinpi`, missing table, private array;
  `test_sycl_speed_lanczos4_parity` = device check.
  On rebase: plain `/` or `sycl::sqrt` added to pipeline kernel, or
  reduction reordered, breaks bit-exact parity
  `test_sycl_speed_*_parity` measures; keep order of every sum
  identical to its `speed.c` / `vif_tools.c` reference.

- **SpEED singular-covariance contract** — see canonical note in
  [`../cuda/AGENTS.md`](../../cuda/AGENTS.md). Since ADR-1358 SYCL
  twins decide singularity on device: `linalg_store()` in
  `speed_sycl_pipeline.cpp` writes per-channel flag, and
  `block_statistics()` solves into zero-initialised private solution
  that stays zero on singular channel, so no device buffer is read
  before it is written. host tail applies one-sided rule and
  copies flags into `FrameResult.singular`. ADR-1218, ADR-1477.

- **SpEED covariance entry is the reference's sequential fp64 sum
  (ADR-2690, `T-SPEED-CHROMA-SYCL-COV-1ULP-2026-10-06`).**
  `speed.c::compute_cov_kernel_scalar()` adds `(x - mean_x) * (y - mean_y)`
  into one fp64 running sum in raster order, rounding every add, and
  `compute_covariance_row()` stores `(float)(sum / (w * h))`. A parallel or
  compensated sum rounded once is not that value: on a cancelling
  off-diagonal entry it stores the neighbouring fp32 value (a real 3840x1600
  10-bit frame, `speed_chroma_u`, 1 ulp). `launch_covariance()` runs
  one work-item per (channel, entry) calling `covariance_entry()` of
  `sycl_speed_cov_math.h`, which replays the sub, sub, mul, add chain in
  64-bit integers (`sycl_soft_signed.h`), the fp64 quotient and the fp32
  conversion. On rebase: never bring back a pair accumulator, a group
  reduction or an `ff_*` quotient for this sum, and never give the entry a
  tolerance. An optimised kernel is allowed only if `test_sycl_speed_cov_math`
  (`==` against `compute_cov_kernel_scalar()`, fixture blocks a near-exact sum
  stores differently) still passes on a device
  (`T-SYCL-SPEED-COV-EXACT-SEQUENTIAL-COST-2026-10-06`).
  `test_sycl_speed_cov_exact_contract.py` pins the source shape. The CUDA and
  HIP twins have the old design (`T-CUDA-SPEED-COV-PAIR-SUM-SUSPECTED-2026-10-06`,
  `T-HIP-SPEED-COV-PAIR-SUM-SUSPECTED-2026-10-06`).

| SYCL TU | CPU TU | Parity test | ADR |
|---|---|---|---|
| `speed_chroma_sycl.cpp` + `speed_sycl_pipeline.cpp` | `speed.c` | `test_sycl_speed_chroma_parity.c`, `test_sycl_speed_singular_parity.c` | ADR-0957 (round 4), ADR-1358 |
| `speed_temporal_sycl.cpp` + `speed_sycl_pipeline.cpp` | `speed.c` | `test_sycl_speed_temporal_parity.c`, `test_sycl_speed_singular_parity.c` | ADR-0957 (round 4), ADR-1358 |

> **SpEED twins are wired and device-resident (ADR-0964, ADR-1358).**
> Both extractors are in `sycl_feature_sources` with shared
> `speed_sycl_pipeline.cpp` and `speed_sycl_host.cpp`. Their parity tests
> are live gates; twins match CPU bit for bit (see
> `docs/metrics/speed_qa.md`).

- Covariance divisor = exact element count `sub_w * sub_h`. SYCL since
  ADR-2690: `covariance_entry()` divides the soft-fp64 sum by the `uint64_t`
  count widened exactly (`signed_div()`, `signed_from_exact()`), the
  reference's fp64 quotient; `count_ff()` / `ff_div_to_float()` no longer
  store a covariance. Never `(float)(sub_w * sub_h)`: above 2^24 (prescale
  > 2 past 16K) odd count has no fp32 value; speed.c divides by exact
  `size_t`. Means divisor stays fp32 (speed.c rounds it too). Guards:
  `test_speed_cov_count_division` (HIP header on host),
  `test_speed_cov_count_contract.py` (CUDA, HIP pair form; SYCL soft-fp64
  quotient, no pair store in the pipeline).
