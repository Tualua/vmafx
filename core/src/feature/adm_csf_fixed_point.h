 *  Representability of the integer-ADM contrast-sensitivity weights.
 *
 *  The integer ADM pipeline stores the CSF weights of one DWT scale as
 *  fixed-point integers:
 *
 *    - scale 0 (16-bit pipeline): `uint16_t i_rfactor[3]`, with the
 *      horizontal / vertical bands scaled by 2^21 and the diagonal band
 *      by 2^23;
 *    - scales 1..3 (32-bit pipeline): `uint32_t i_rfactor[3]`, all three
 *      bands scaled by 2^32.
 *
 *  Storage is not the binding limit. The contrast-masking reduction squares
 *  the weighted sample and narrows the square to int32, so a weight is in
 *  budget only when the largest wavelet coefficient of its scale, weighted,
 *  still has a square that fits (ADR-1472; the bounds are below).
 *
 *  Those budgets were sized for the Watson97 CSF, whose weights sit around
 *  1e-2. The fork-added `adm_csf_mode` option (integer_adm.h) also exposes
 *  the Barten CSF, whose weights are ~1.2 at scale 0 and ~27 at scale 3 with
 *  the default `adm_csf_scale` of 1.0 -- 38x to 155x past the uint16_t
 *  ceiling at scale 0 and past the uint32_t ceiling at every other scale.
 *  The narrowing conversions in the extractors silently wrapped, and the
 *  resulting scores were nonsense rather than an error.
 *
 *  This header centralises the bounds and the shared power-of-two
 *  normalisation used by every integer-ADM backend.  A single shift is used
 *  for all three bands of one scale, preserving their relative CSF weights;
 *  the contrast-masking reduction restores the removed exponent after its
 *  cube.  Invalid negative / non-finite table results are still rejected.
 *  See ADR-1191, ADR-1325, ADR-1472, and
 *  docs/state.md :: T-UPSTREAM-1494-ADM-CSF-MODE-IRFACTOR-OVERFLOW-2026-09-03.
 *
 *  The frame-size bound and the rounding constant of the pipeline's right
 *  shifts, at the end of this file, are shared for the same reason. See
 *  docs/state.md :: T-ADM-AVX512-SMALL-WIDTH-SCALE0-2026-09-18 and
 *  T-GPU-ADM-TINY-FRAME-SHIFT-2026-09-18.

 * Arithmetic budget of the contrast-masking cube (ADR-1472).
 *
 * Per sample the reduction forms the excess `v` of the weighted coefficient
 * over its masking threshold, then `v_sq = (int32_t)((v * v + round) >> s)`
 * and `v_sq * v` (adm_cm_accum_round(), i4_adm_cm_accum_round(), and their
 * SIMD and device twins). The square fits int32 only up to
 *
 *   s = 29 (scale 0, horizontal / vertical):   v <= 2^30 - 1
 *   s = 30 (scale 0 diagonal, scales 1..3):    v <= 1518500249
 *
 * A larger excess wraps: the cube turns negative or small, the score is wrong,
 * and a negative accumulator ends as NaN in the p-norm.
 *
 * The excess is at most the weighted coefficient, plus 28 at scales 1..3
 * (the threshold there can be as low as -27, ADR-0155's rounding term, and
 * the weighting rounds). The weighted coefficient is `band * weight` at
 * scale 0 and `(band * weight) >> 28` at scales 1..3. So the weight budget
 * of a scale is the excess budget divided by the largest coefficient the
 * wavelet can produce there.
 *
 * That coefficient is bounded by the filter taps, whatever the picture: a
 * detail band is a linear function of the centred pixel p / 2^bpc - 1/2,
 * which lies in [-1/2, 1/2), so its magnitude is at most half the absolute
 * sum of the composite filter, in the band's fixed-point format (2^14 at
 * scale 0, 2^29, 2^27 and 2^26 at scales 1, 2 and 3):
 *
 *   scale 0:   22929.4      scale 2:   751508000
 *   scale 1:   1448980000   scale 3:   742509000
 *
 * (the larger of the horizontal / vertical and the diagonal band; a frame
 * built from the sign pattern of the composite filter reaches 99.6 % of each
 * at 8 bits). The constants below round those up by about half a percent,
 * which covers the pipeline's rounding and the decouple stage's reciprocal
 * table. core/test/test_integer_adm_cm_budget.c derives the bounds again
 * from the taps and holds them against these constants.
