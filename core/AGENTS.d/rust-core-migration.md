# Rust core migration (ADR-2478)

- New host-side implementation: Rust. Exception: layer still C per ADR-2478 phase table.
- Layer with Rust successor: fix lands in C oracle and Rust, same PR.
- C = differential oracle until layer's C deleted (3.0). Never weaken oracle to pass Rust.
- Layer C builds only in oracle-only Meson profile after phase exit.
- Native device sources + C-only host glue: exception list only: file, rule, reason, trigger, expiry.
- ABI source = `core/api/vmafx.toml`. Never hand-edit exported surface.
- Stable toolchain pinned; nightly only sanitizer lanes + GPU device crates.
- Epic: #2567.
